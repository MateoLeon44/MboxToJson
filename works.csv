I am now receiving less BOMBS when I am on-line:therefore, I believe it is better than the last version.There is, though, one little agonizing message 'Image Toolbar'that pops up every time you pass the mouse over an image.It asks whether you want to save or print the image. UGH,what a pest.Hurrah, you can get rid of the Image Toolbar. Justperform a Right Mouse Click over the Image Toolbar.It will allow you to disable the Image Toolbar forthis session or forever. If you want to re-establishthe Image Toolbar just go to the Internet OptionsControl Panel and you can turn the Image Toolbar back on.Remember, a right mouse click over any Windows Icon,Window, tool bar, the Desktop, and most other Windowsentities will list loads of information.

It is a bit slow loading as would be the case with so much animation.I guess it will always be slow with all that. I do not like pop up pages and therewas one that kept doing that. Some of the pages were really pretty but theanimation did not fit the mood of the page. A tremendous amout of work hasbeen put into the page. There are so many places to host websites inexpensively,why don't you have your own domain? You ought to check into that.~~~~This is a very lovely site, the graphics are awesome and the games are funas well. You may want to look into purchasing your own domain name anda host that offers bannerless hosting (at least without the pop-ups).~~~~Hmm... too much input! There's way too much loading on this page. I don'tlike the wav file loading and though I didn't here anything windows promptedme for a MP3 decoder, so I presume one of those was loading as well. Someof the links are pretty cool but perhaps the main menu should be also textbased or smaller gifs and put on the index page. For a minute I didn't knowwhere to go.~~~~This was a neat site.  The site was original and I could tell that Mrs. T certainlyseems to enjoy working on her site.  The graphics were pretty, or funny,depending on each one, but well arranged. But, the text on the home pagewas going from the left side to the right side with no margins so it overlappedthe left rose border. I'd suggest moving the margins in a little bit.  Also, I thinkusing a sans-serif font like arial would be easier to read, though I did like howthe font color matched the flowers. BTW, I was viewing the site with internetexplorer.I don't think you need the 'welcome' on both the home page and the site guidepage, it's overkill. I also didn't figure out the association between mrstgifts,interactive opinions, and a site on graphics. Relating the name of your site tothe site content helps when new visitors visit.On your home page you say something about trying to design your own graphics.If you do so, try starting with a logo for your site. I realize you are showingdifferent pictures and styles, but it would be nice to have a logo or the samepicture on each page so it's easy to tell I'm still visiting the same website. Onyour articles page it was hard to see the titles by the earth graphics becauseof the background colors. Maybe putting them in a table with the backgroundbehind that would work better.Look for a host that doesn't use pop-ups - I would have checked out morepages but I hated getting those pop-ups each time I clicked to a new page.I went to your articles site and that was at homestead - that bar is much easierto deal with than the pop-ups. I'd suggest moving your whole site there.~~~~This is an interesting site - it covers a large variety of subjects - not all of whichI visited - and it has something for every member of the family, however, mostof it is for either mothers or the kids. She even has some games to play - goodfor smaller kids, too! Mrs. T., as she is known, is quite creative - and I wouldrecommend this site for the whole family.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~VOTE ON YOUR FAVORITE WEBSITE DESIGN!Help out the winner of the free website redesign by voting forYOUR favorite!You can help out Teddy at http://www.links4profit.com by taking alook at his site, then checking out the three new layouts Jana ofAkkaBay Designs http://AkkaBay.com has designed specificallyfor him.

"drphillips@management.com"|"DR MARKUS PHILLIPS"|"BUSINESS ASSISTANCE"|"Dear Sir.First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virture of its nature as being utterly confidencial and top secret. all though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.we have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction, let me start by introducing myself properly to you.I am the Manager Bills and Exchange of Foreign Remittance Department of Union Bank of NIgeria (U.B.N. Headquarters Lagos Nigeria) formally Union Bank of Switzerland(UBS-AG Zurich Switzerland). In accordance with Federal Government Policies on indiginalization Law on company and Allied matters of Jan 1977. I am writing you this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction.We discovered an abandoned sum of US$7. 5 million(Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our Foreign customer who died along side his entire family in November 1997 in a plane crash. Since this development, we have advertised for his next of kin or any close relation to come forward to claim this money, but nobody came to apply for the claim.To this effect, I and two other officials in my department, have decided to look for a trusted foreign partner who can stand in as the next of  kin to the deceased and claim this money.We need !a foreign partner to apply for the claim because of the fact that the customer was a foreigner and we don't want this money to go into the Banks Treasury as unclaimed fund. Every document to affect this process will emanate from my table and I will perfect every document to be in accordance with the banking law and guidelines, So you have nothing to worry about.We have agreed that 20% of the money will be for you, 10% for expenses incurred on both sides, 10% will be donated to the charity organization while 60% will be for my colleagues and I. If you are going to help me, indicate by replying this letter and putting in your BANK PARTICULARS, PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.I await your immediate reply to enable us start this transaction in earnest.Once I receive your reply, I will send you the Text of application for immediate application of Claim.Yours faithfully,DR MARKUS PHILLIPS."

This recommendation is based on the information that you will not betray the trust and confidence to be reposed in you. I am Romila Kabila the second son of the assassinated former President Of Democratic Republic Of Congo (D.C) Late Laurent Desire Kabila who on Tuesday 16 January   during the four years rule of my father I was his confidential/private security and base on my position of relationship of father and son. I was able to be in change of the president's personal security vault and some of his savings.Now following the death of my father, the immediate family of the late President Kabila has met and concluded that some savings and security vault of the former President should be moved out of the troubled Democratic Republic of Congo with immediate president of Democratic republic of Congo by the late Kabila has been appointed president of democratic republic of Congo by the late kabila's national executive council and the country top military brass, and properties worth millions of US$ to relocate the late president kabila's assets and properties with millions of dollars  to over sea country where there is good political climate. We have concluded arrangement to move/transfer the sum US$42M to a finance and security company in London through a Diplomatic courier services. The family through a diplomatic contact during my father's regime, conclude an arrangement to lodge/deposit the above sums with the GLOBAL DIPLOMATIC AND SECURITY SERVICES in LONDON - U.K!. And it is on this, that I am soliciting for your assistance to help us receive this amount from this security company once it arrives London upon your acceptance to assist in this project as we the family member can not do it on our own because of the code of conduct, which was introduced by my late father to checkmate excess embezzlement/siphoning of the Government/public funds overseas country as the case had be during the Late President Mobutu Sese Seko. So one cannot make law and destroy the same law. Therefore if you can render your assistance, please indicate your interest to me through my email romkabila@presidency.com, you should then urgently arrange to travel to London and clear the (consignments) funds upon it arrival and subsequent payment of the US$42M into your bank account. As soon as we hear from you, we then send a representative to be with you in London to represent our interest. Based on your anticipated efforts and contri!bution the family has resolved to give you 20% commission and the remaining 80% will be reclaimed by the family. It will be my pleasure to be able to co-operate with you on terms that you may wish for the successful completion of this project. Thanks and remain blessed.Best Regards,ROMILA KABILA"

I am Hajia Maryam Abacha, the wife of late Nigerian Head of State, General Sanni Abacha, who died on the 8th of June 1998. ever since the death of my husband, my family has been facing a lot of problems mostly with the present civilian government. Consequently, my son - Mohammed Abacha has been under torture in detention for a sin he did not commit and made to make a lot of confessions as regards valuables and money, including that of my late husband entrusted in his hand for safe keeping. The latest is the confession of the US$700,000,000.00 (Seven Hundred Million United States Dollars) cash his late father gave him for safe keeping.

Please confirm this issue on website: http://www.thisdayonline.com, click the Archieve/2001/March 2001/Thursday March 1st.On this note, I deposited a total sum of US$40,300,000.00 (Forty Million, three hundred thousand United states Dollars) sometimes March last year with a security company abroad (name withheld for now). Normally, we (1 and Mohammed Abacha) usually do such transactions, by first sending the money out by cargo to security company outside Nigeria, as photographic materials.And thereafter go to the security company for claims before transferring it to any bank of our choice. Presently, I cannot travel out of Nigeria, because, if you have gone through the above mentioned website address, you will see how my son's confessions had implicated my husband and in fact the whole of my family. This has actually caused the federal Government of Nigeria to confiscate our International passports, frozen every of my family member's bank accounts, both home and abroad, even our properties. My problem now is, I want someone that can assist me move the US$40,300,000.00 (Forty Million Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) out from the Security Company and move the money to your country.I shall be ready to negotiate with you any percentage you might want from the sum.

Since this development, we have advertised for his next of kin or any close relation to come forward to claim this money, but nobody came to apply for the claim.To this effect, I and two other officials in my department, have decided to look for a trusted foreign partner who can stand in as the next of  kin to the deceased and claim this money.We need !a foreign partner to apply for the claim because of the fact that the customer was a foreigner and we don't want this money to go into the Banks Treasury as unclaimed fund. Every document to affect this process will emanate from my table and I will perfect every document to be in accordance with the banking law and guidelines, So you have nothing to worry about.We have agreed that 20% of the money will be for you, 10% for expenses incurred on both sides, 10% will be donated to the charity organization while 60% will be for my colleagues and I.

"stanleywoodwork@eircom.net"|""|"business intent"|"Dear Sir,I am Stanley Woodwork, the secetary of Africa White farmersco-operation (AWFC) OF Zimbabwe. After the last general elections in my country where the incumbent president Mr. Robert Mugabe won the presidential election, thegovernment has adopted a very aggressive land reforms programme. This programme is solely aimed at taking the land owned by white African farmers for redistribution to black africans. This programme has attracted worldwidecondemnation from world leaders including British prime minister,mr Tony Blair and also forced several white farmers to flee the country for fear ofvictimization and physical abuse.   Two weeks ago, our headquartes in Harare was attacked andlooted by black protesters and in the process burnt down the whole building. Fortunately,they did not get access to the huge funds kept in the strong room whichbelong to the co-operation. This cash was kept at the secretariat rather than in the bank for fear of seizure by the government.   Now I have the funds in my possession and would need to get it invested in a viable business venture in europe. The cash in question is US$46Million dollars.   Once I can get your commitment and sincerity of investingthis funds on our behalf then I would proceed to get the funds freighted to Europe, where you would be required to pick it up for investment for us.   You do not have anything to worry about as I would undertake all charges involved in freighting the funds to europe, and the business proposal is 100% legal and risk free.   You would be adequately compensated for all your effort once we have gotten the funds to europe.Please get back to me if you can be of assistance and I would want our correspondence to be via email as most phone lines of white farmers are bugged by the government.   I expect 100% confidentiality and your prompt response tothis mail so as to proceed.you may also reach me on stanleywoodwork@email.comKind regards,Stanley Woodwork."

Anyway, now I am here instead of her too.So, my name is Oksana Svetlova, I live in St. Petersburg, Russia.I have an idea, how we could cooperate to mutual benefit, see, possibly you will find it interesting.People are seeking to cut costs with this economy slow-down, right?The thing is that I could get you in touch with developers fromRussia, who will be happy to do a web designer's work for you forconsiderably less, than you possibly take from your clients (or pay for web-design?), and with _professional_ quality. Also - allprogramming, Internet-programming, graphic, flash design, contentwriting, translations, etc. If you do web-design, then you mayaccept more orders at once, getting a good share from each, anddevote yourself only to that work, you find most interesting.Alternatively, you can realize more your ideas to develop, morefeatures to add to your existing sites, and with low costs: from$12, and an average of $18 an hour.I have put links to their works at www.antee.com/samples_and_faq.htmlAs for reliability, I just saw, how carefully they hand-picked theirspecialists, and under what tight management they do their projects.So, from past experience, it was almost always possible to meet deadlines. Also, communication is properly thought-out: a consultant is online in ICQ and other instant messengers almost each day, also their company has local consultants in many states throughout the USA, in Europe and Australia.So, what do you think? A possibility for cooperation?Thank you very much,Oksana Svetlova.oksana@antee.comPS.

In order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your nominated account the said floating funds. We are determined to conclude the transfer before the end of this quarter of 2002. The source of the funds is as follows: During the last military regime in Nigeria, government Officials set up companies and awarded themselves contracts that were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries and parastatals. The present civilian government set up the contract Review Panel, which has the mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to it by the decree setting up the panel, to review these contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts. My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of these funds which are presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes. However, by virtue of our positions as civil servants !and members of this panel, we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names of companies that are based in Nigeria. I have therefore been mandated, as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of U.S.$25,500,000.00 (Twenty Five million, five hundred thousand U.S.dollars). That is why I am writing you this letter.We have agreed to share the money to be Transferred into your account, if you agree with our proposition as follows:  (i) 20%to the account owner (you). ( ii) 70% for us (the panel officials   (iii)10% to be used in settling all expenses(by both you and us) incidental to the actualization of this project.We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign stock markets and other business till we are ready and able to have access to them without raising any eyebrows here at home. Please note that this transaction is 100% safe and risk-free. WeIntend to effect the transfer within fourteen (14) banking days from the date of receipt of the following information through the fax number stated above_-:Your Bank's name, Companys name, address, telephone and fax numbers and the account number into which  the funds should be paid. The above information will enable us write letters of claim and job description respectively. This way, we will use your companys name to apply for the payment and backdate the award of the contract to your company. We are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction. Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using my direct Telephone number 234 1775 5791 and my America Internet Fax number 240 744 0416 or 801 516 7986 only.It was acquired for the purpose of confidentiality. I will bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction when I hear from you.Best regards,BEN KOKORI                                                                                                                  "

"d_kar27@post.com"|"David  Kargbou"|"DANIEL  KARGBO. fork !"|" fork ,From:Mr.David  Kargbou and Family,         Johannesburg,South Africa.My Dear ,Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.My name is Mr.David  Kargbou,the second son of Mr.Smith Thabo Kargbou,of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the la st undemocratic elections decided to block and confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Seven Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$7.400.000.00]in a Trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and bloc ked by the present Mugabe's regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.Now this is what I actually want you to do for me:1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.Best Regards, Mr.David Kargbou and family. http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork"

"mailroom@speededelivery.com"|"Steve Down"|"Fw: The Gold Buddha"|"In 1957, a monastery in Thailand was being relocated and a group of monkswas put in charge of moving a giant clay Buddha. In the midst of the moveone of the monks noticed a crack in the Buddha. Concerned about damaging theidol, the monks decided to wait for a day before continuing with their task.When night came, one of the monks came to check on the giant statue. Heshined his flashlight over the entire Buddha. When he reached the crack hesaw something reflected back at him. The monk, his curiosity aroused, got ahammer and a chisel and began chipping away at the clay Buddha. As heknocked off piece after piece of clay, the Buddha got brighter and brighter.After hours of work, the monk looked up in amazement to see standing beforehim a huge solid-gold Buddha.Many historians believe the Buddha had been covered with clay by Thai monksseveral hundred years earlier before an attack by the Burmese army. Theycovered the Buddha to keep it from being stolen. In the attack all the monkswere killed, so it wasn't until 1957, when the monks were moving the giantstatue, that the great treasure was discovered. Like the Buddha, our outershell protects us from the word: our real treasure is hidden within. Wehuman beings unconsciously hide our inner gold under a layer of clay. All weneed to do to uncover our gold is to have the courage to chip away at ourouter shell, piece by piece.Could you be sitting on your own gold mine? Did you know the averageAmerican can retire a millionaire on his or her current income? Then, whydon't they? It's simple. They haven't been taught that they could.

"tfumlmprospect_111815@hotpop.com"|"Paul Starsky"|"Weekly Stock Report vjf"|"GAMING ADVISOR  NEWS July 16, 2002   i2corp Enters into Research and Development Agreement with Nevada Gaming Equipment Supplier For Live Remote Bingo.       The general feeling of the Top Internet Lawyers and Analysts is that 'online gambling and sports betting is here to stay.Â Attempts at trying to stop it would be largely ineffective! Banning Internet gambling and sports betting presents technical and legal problems that Governments are ill equipped to enforce. WhatÂs more, there are NO competitors for the CompanyÂs method or technology for remote wagering. i2corp is the Only Company in the World that can legally license its method and technology for remote wagering. i2corp is currently negotiating withMajor Casinos Globally.     Michael Pollock of the Pollock Gaming Resource Group (PRRG) has issued a report studying the effects of live wagering from remote locations. Â The study concludes that live wagering from remote locations does more than create a new source of revenue for sponsoring casinos. Additionally, it creates a marketing opportunity, a means to find and cultivate thousands of new customers who can be encouraged to become on-site patrons.Â A copy of the full report in pdf format can be downloaded at http://www.gamingobserver.com/. i2corp is the holding company for Home Gambling Network, Inc. HGN holds U.S. Patent 5,800,268, which covers remote wagering on live games and events with electronic financial transactions. The Patent is comprised of three primary actions: the gambling is live: the player is remote and physically away from the actual game or event: and the winnings and losses are transacted electronically in real time. They include, but are not limited to, horse racing, soccer, bingo, poker, roulette and many other Las Vegas Casino Games.

We needed legal advice and we needed it right away. Unfortunately, beingmiddle class, put us in the wrong income bracket to have such a necessity. Nowall of this has changed.Think about the issues that can suddenly come up in your personal life: * Monday: The dog bit the mailman - Do you know what to do? * Tuesday: The Building Inspector drops by and announces that the permits on   file with their office do not allow your garage conversion. 'What now,' you   think to yourself. * Wednesday: You've been considering home-schooling your children for some   time. Now your daughter announces that she is being picked on yet again, and   simply will not attend another day. What are the legal ramifications of home   schooling your children?Â * Thursday: Speeding Ticket goes to warrant for your 17-year-old son. You   haven't a clue how to handle it. * Friday: Your ex-spouse has missed another child support payment. . . Who do   you call?And what about all the other things: * Received a Traffic Ticket You Thought Was Unjustified? * Paid a Bill You Knew Was Unfair? * Lost a Security Deposit? * Bought a Home or Purchased A Car? * Signed an Employment Contract? * Had difficulty collecting an insurance claim? * Had Trouble With Your Credit Report? * Been Involved in a Landlord or Property Dispute? * Been Involved in a separation or divorce? * Had to Collect Child Support? * Prepared A Will or Wanted To? * In your personal life, you need legal representation available to you all the   time. But most of us never have it because we can't afford it.Now there is a program that not only provides quality legal help, but itprovides it 24 hours a day, with an attorney helping you the same day you callthem - and it is for a small monthly fee.

In accordance with Federal Government Policies on indiginalization Law on company and Allied matters of Jan 1977. I am writing you this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction.We discovered an abandoned sum of US$20 million(twenty million US Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our Foreign customer who died along side his entire family in November 1997 in a plane crash. Since this development,we have advertised for his next of kin or any close relation to come forward to claim this money, but nobody came to apply for the claim. To this effect,I and two other officials in my department, have decided to look for a trusted foreign partner who can stand in as the next of kin to the deceased and claim this money.We need a foreign partner to apply for the claim because of the fact that the customer was a foreigner and we don't want this money to go into the Banks Treasury as unclaimed fund. Every document to affect this process will emanate from my table and I will perfect every documentto be in accordance with the banking law and guidelines,So you have nothing to worry about.We have agreed that 20% of the moneywill be for you, 10%for expenses incurred on both sides, 10% will bedonated to the charity organization while 60% will be for my colleaguesand I.

The only thing US investors should be asking themselves is, 'How can I participate in this explosion?' We have the answer. Texas-based CommunicateNow.com, Inc. (OTC BB trading symbol: CMNW) may unlock China's amazing potential.INVESTOR'S TIMING OPPORTUNITYTexas-based CommunicationsNow.com Inc. (OTCBB trading symbol: CMNW) announces today that a top representative from CMNW will be traveling to China in an attempt to negotiate with one of China's top manufacturers ofhigh pressure laminate products for CMNW to act as a worldwide distributorof its products. You know what the Chinese did to the global steel market:they captured it! China is now set to conquer another major commodity, andyou can profit right along with them. This is just one example of how CMNW may make company history.Opening China's DoorUsing hard-won experience gained in the survivor-takes-all US Internet market, CMNW developed technology that makes it possible for China's millions of entrepreneurs, small and medium sized companies, and major corporations to do business worldwide via the Internet. Chinese makers of porcelain, for example, can deal direct with US consumers and retailers. Say 'goodbye' to the layers of middlemen.CMNW strives to become a World Wide Wholesaler CMNW is attempting to become an International wholesaler to the world. Thisis an enormous goal. Many believe that trade with China built the world's greatestfortunes, from the golden age of Venice to the British Empire. Now this potentialis being transferred to the Internet, and CMNW will attempt to capture it.CMNW puts all this into your portfolio: stability of a US-based company... sky-rocketing China market...convenience of a US-listed stock...dynamics of a growth company. *** For the latest quarterly report on CMNW, go to www.freeedgar.com *** Obviously, you cannot go back in time to the year 1901 and invest in baby US companies like Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson as they were getting started. But you can grab the modern day equivalent. That's right. The growth potential in China at this very minute is like the United States at the start of the 20th century -- perhaps even greater. There's much more to the CMNW story. Including a major expansion into Mexico.

The highestconcentration of ellagitannins are found in raspberry seeds. The delivery of theellagitannins, however, is the key to the effectiveness of the product. We useraspberry seed materials processed using a patented method, which is the ONLYmethod that guarantees the maximum delivery of available phytoestrogens,polyphenols, and antioxidants.

These plant based compounds, or phytoestrogens, when absorbed,provide many beneficial effects including stimulation of collagen formation. Itis now known that the powerful agents in the raspberry seed materials tone thetiny blood vessels under the eye and decrease the release of the brown chemicalpigment. The results are a decrease the appearance of the dark circles under theeyes. These materials also help to decrease the appearance of 'AGE' brown spots,while smoothing WRINKLES, strengthening HAIR and NAILS, and supporting manyother significant health issues!

They have been growinglike crazy! C.C., OH This is a unique, one of a kind product. I have been usingit 3 weeks and I can truly see a difference in the liver spots on my hands. Theprescription from my dermatologist didn't do it, but this product did.

I have tried everything for years to get rid ofcellulite - the creams, the wraps - nothing worked. My husband kept telling meto try this. Finally I did it just to get him off my back. I had not worn shortsfor 5 years. After about 10 days, my husband started telling me my legs werelooking better. I thought he was just being nice since he got me into this. ThenI went shopping, and in the lights in the dressing room, for the first time in along time I looked pretty good. I went into the next dressing room, because Ithought the lights were wrong, but I still looked good. I ended up buyingshorts, and have been wearing shorts for the 1st time in 5 years. Yes, itworks!! G.C., TX We just had a booth at the womenÂs expo in Dallas. Out of the300 or 400 exhibitors there, the only other spot that had the people we did werethe ones giving out free food.

I know how you feel- I print over 500 pages a day, and it feels like there isa vacuum sucking money out of my wallet! Now, this has gotto stop because I know it doesn't cost the printer companiesanywhere near what it costs me to do my office and school work!Well, it finally has.  The SUPERINK solution.You're probably thinking to yourself, 'Gosh darn, not anothercheap knockoff printer cartridge!'Â  Like you, I was very skeptical at first, but my best friend & business associatesaid it helped her save over $100 a month on printer supplies.

Take a moment and learn his long sought after SECRETS.This PI is the originator of seeking out Judicial Judgments and using them to make a FORTUNE!  Most people have no idea what a Judicial Judgment is, much less how to process them to earn a very substantial income.Heres the SCOOP-  When one person or business files suit against another and wins, the winner then has a JUDICIAL JUDGMENT.BUT, even though they won- guess what? They soon find out these SHOCKING FACTS:a) Its now up to them to Collect on the Judgmentb) The court does not require the loser to pay you. c) The court will not help you to collect it. d) Employees of the court are FORBIDDEN BY LAW from telling you how to collect the judgment. All the winner really has is a WORTHLESS piece of paper. They must trace the loser down, find their assets: their employment, bank accounts, real estate, stocks and bonds, etc. And THE WINNER has to pay all the expenses to find this out.  All of a sudden that BIG CASH SETTLEMENT the person got, has become an expense instead of an asset!  WHAT HAPPENS THEN?- MILLIONS of Judgments just sit in files and become forgotten. people give up trying.  Right now in the United States there are between 200 and 300 BILLION dollars of uncollected JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs. For every Judgment that is paid, 5 or more unpaid Judgments take its place. So how does this Private Investigator make a FORTUNE collecting other peoples judgments?  Thats what we want to tell you.  Through long and hard work, this Sleuth has learned a process that will turn these forgotten useless pieces of paper into a FORTUNE without the high collection cost.The income potential is substantial in this profession! Using the techniques taught in his course , people are now working full-time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per year. Part-time associates are earning between $24,000.00 and $100,000.00 per year. Most choose to work out of their homes, others build sizable organizations.Today, people trained in this business opportunity are processing over 500 million dollars in JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs!  AND, new judgments become available every day.  The work isALWAYS there, you just need to know how to go about it. This is a GREAT OPPORTUNITY for anyone who wants to start something on the side that will offer a solid income in the future. It is also ideal because you determine how much time you want to spend doing this and when. Make no mistake though-THIS IS NOT A GET RICH QUICK SCHEME. It requires effort on your part.

Take a moment and learn his long sought after SECRETS.This PI is the originator of seeking out Judicial Judgments and using them to make a FORTUNE!  Most people have no idea what a Judicial Judgment is, much less how to process them to earn a very substantial income.Heres the SCOOP-  When one person or business files suit against another and wins, the winner then has a JUDICIAL JUDGMENT.BUT, even though they won- guess what? They soon find out these SHOCKING FACTS:a) Its now up to them to Collect on the Judgmentb) The court does not require the loser to pay you. c) The court will not help you to collect it. d) Employees of the court are FORBIDDEN BY LAW from telling you how to collect the judgment. All the winner really has is a WORTHLESS piece of paper. They must trace the loser down, find their assets: their employment, bank accounts, real estate, stocks and bonds, etc. And THE WINNER has to pay all the expenses to find this out.  All of a sudden that BIG CASH SETTLEMENT the person got, has become an expense instead of an asset!  WHAT HAPPENS THEN?- MILLIONS of Judgments just sit in files and become forgotten. people give up trying.  Right now in the United States there are between 200 and 300 BILLION dollars of uncollected JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs. For every Judgment that is paid, 5 or more unpaid Judgments take its place. So how does this Private Investigator make a FORTUNE collecting other peoples judgments?  Thats what we want to tell you.  Through long and hard work, this Sleuth has learned a process that will turn these forgotten useless pieces of paper into a FORTUNE without the high collection cost.The income potential is substantial in this profession! Using the techniques taught in his course , people are now working full-time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per year. Part-time associates are earning between $24,000.00 and $100,000.00 per year. Most choose to work out of their homes, others build sizable organizations.Today, people trained in this business opportunity are processing over 500 million dollars in JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs!  AND, new judgments become available every day.  The work isALWAYS there, you just need to know how to go about it. This is a GREAT OPPORTUNITY for anyone who wants to start something on the side that will offer a solid income in the future. It is also ideal because you determine how much time you want to spend doing this and when. Make no mistake though-THIS IS NOT A GET RICH QUICK SCHEME. It requires effort on your part.

"edum@hkem.com"|"edum"|"[dcms-dev] MY INHERITANCE"|"Date:May 16,2002. Email:edum@hkem.com. Dear Sir, I am Mr.Eduado de Mello, one of the Principal Commanders of the Union for the Total Independence of Angola,UNITA.Well needless telling a very long story here for our story is indeed interwoven with the history of the world and the liberation struggle in the Southern African region of the African continent. The bubble burst just about some weeks ago today when my supreme commander, the late Dr.Jonas Savimbi was killed in an encounter with the government forces of the MPLA government of my country.The rest is now history but suffice it to say that I am tired of the unfortunate role of waging a war against my fatherland.I have therefore decided to pull out my troupes from the bush even if the other field commanders decide otherwise am therefore poised to effect a new beginning in my life and I have decided to make South Africa my new home at least for the interim period until I am sufficiently sure that I would be welcome home whole heartedly by the MPLA government in Luanda the capital of Angola. Needles to say I was the single most important commander who was very close to the late supreme commander: Dr.Jonas Savimbi.Indeed because I am a brother to one of his wives,he confided in me a great deal.The result of such trust is my reason for contacting you I was the commander whom he sent to deposit the sum of Thirty two million USD ($32million) with a security/finance company in South Africa.This was immediately after the events of September 11,2001 in the United States of America.Indeed it had become increasingly difficult to move large volumes of money around the world particularly for a liberation movement like UNITA hence the recourse to keeping the money with the security company in South Africa. I have decided to inherit this money which was taken out and deposited with the said security/finance company as cash in Hundred dollar denominations.The money is kept in my signature and would have been used in the purchase of arms and ammunition for the purposes of continuing the civil war in Angola.The supreme commander is dead and as already stated I have decided to quite the whole thing and this is without regard to the fact that other commanders may wish to continue ! I want to cooperate with you in my decision to inherit the $32million.I am still in the bush here but I have been able to establish contact with the company in South Africa to the effect that I would soon come to take possession of the money that I kept with them. Note also that I deposited the money as a foreign national who is the head of a Mining company in Angola (Never as a commander of UNITA). If you are able to cooperate with me over this am willing to give you 20% of the $32million.Please come back to me through email: edum@hkem.com.The security/finance company is standing by to receive my instructions on this and I will link you up with them as soon as you are ready to take possession of the $32million. Finally you are to note that in you reply, you are to state your residential or company address and if possible send a copy of your international passport so as to assure me that my money is safe in your hands. Yours truly, Eduado de Mello _______________________________________________dcms-dev mailing listdcms-dev@eros.cs.jhu.eduhttp://www.eros-os.org/mailman/listinfo/dcms-dev"

A few months back I joined a program and then...promptly forgotabout it. You may have done this yourself sometime...you intendto work the program but then get caught in your day-to-dayactivities and it's soon forgotten.The program was free to join so maybe I just didn't take it very seriously.Anyway, near the end of May I received a letter from my sponsor (Vic Patalano) informing me that I had more than 1000 PAID members in my group! As you can imagine, I was very skeptical. After all, how could I have more than 1000 paid members under me in a program that I hadnever promoted?I took the time to check out the site...then wrote to Vic asking for confirmation that these were paid members and not just free sign-ups...like me :)Well, it was true...I had over 1000 paid members in my group. This is a program that I had never worked! All I had to do was upgrade to a paid membership before the end of the month and I would have my position locked in and a group of over 1000 people. You can bet I wasted no time in getting my membership upgraded!I can tell you, if I had known what was happening with this program, I would have become an active paid member months ago! With this program, you will get a HUGE group of PAID MEMBERS.My sponsor's check, which is a minimum of $5,000, arrives everymonth...on time.How would you like to lock your position in FREE while you checkout this opportunity and watch your group grow?To grab a FREE ID#, simply reply to:  sejr102@yahoo.comand write this phrase:'Email me details about the club's business and consumer opportunities'Be sure to include your:1. First name2. Last name3. Email address (if different from above)Once I receive your reply, I will submit your information and you will receive an e-mail titled 'your name, Activate Your FREE Membership Today!' You will then need to confirm your FREE Membership.We will then send you a special report, along with your Free Membership ID Number and also let you know how you can keep track of your growing group, then you can make up your own mind.That's all there is to it.Warm regards,Sean P.S. After having several negative experiences with networkmarketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.This company is different--it offers value, integrity, and aREAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...and finally make real money on the internet.Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive theprogram for FREE.

We are not looking for people who are self-motivated.         We are not looking for people who join every 'get rich                    quick' scheme offered on the Internet.            We are not looking for class presidents, beautiful             people, career builders or even college graduates.     We don't even want union workers or trade school graduates.         We want the laziest people that exist - the guys and        gals who expect to make money without lifting a finger.             We want the people who stay in bed until noon.    We want those of you who think that getting out of bed to go       lay on the couch is an effort that is best not thought about.                          If you meet these criteria, go to:                         livinghealthytoday@hotmail.com              and type in the Subject Line the following words:                             'I do not want to work'.              In fact, if you are so lazy that typing those words              in the Subject line is an effort, than don't bother.           Just click on the email and we'll know that you want      us to send you the domain name anyhow, because then               we will be absolutely certain that you are the                              kind of person we want.                      In case you haven't figured it out yet, we want                  the kind of people who DO NOT take risks.          If you are the kind of person who will consider doing      something that's NOT a 'sure thing', then do NOT respond.                    This is too easy a way to make money                          and there's no challenge in it.            If you can get to the website that we are going               to email you, you will be able to see the first        home business in history that requires no work.  NONE.                 By clicking on this email and then going to                this website, you will be telling us that you             want to make enough money that you can quit                      your regular job and sleep all day.               We are not looking for a commitment from you                    and we don't even want your money.               As a matter of fact, we don't even want you             to hear from us again if the idea of making lots            of money without working does not interest you.                                    So this is the first                                and last email we will                                     ever send you.                                     That is a promise.                        So if nothing else, remember this -                      to make money without working for it just                       send an email with the following words                  in the subject line:  'I do not want to work' to:                             livinghealthytoday@hotmail.com                        and we will email you back with the                        website that gives you information                             on the best of both worlds -                a way to make money without having to work.

Co-investment Program"|"The Financial News, May 2002Production Mini-plants in mobile containers. Co-investment Program'...Science Network will supply to countries and developing regions the technology and the necessary support for the production in series of Mini-plants in mobile containers (40-foot). The Mini-plant system is designed in such a way that all the production machinery is fixed on the platform of the container, with all wiring, piping, and installation parts: that is to say, they are fully equipped... and the mini-plant is ready for production.'More than 700 portable production systems: Bakeries, Steel Nails, Welding Electrodes, Tire Retreading, Reinforcement Bar Bending for Construction Framework, Sheeting for Roofing, Ceilings and Façades, Plated Drums, Aluminum Buckets, Injected Polypropylene Housewares, Pressed Melamine Items (Glasses, Cups, Plates, Mugs, etc.), Mufflers, Construction Electrically Welded Mesh, Plastic Bags and Packaging, Mobile units of medical assistance, Sanitary Material, Hypodermic Syringes, Hemostatic Clamps, etc. Science Network has started a process of Co-investment for the installation of small Assembly plants to manufacture in series the Mini-plants of portable production on the site, region or country where they may be required. One of the most relevant features is the fact that these plants will be connected to the World Trade System (WTS) with access to more than 50 million raw materials, products and services and automatic transactions for world trade.Because of financial reasons, involving cost and social impact, the right thing to do is to set up assembly plants in the same countries and regions, using local resources (labor, some equipment, etc.)For more information: <A HREF='mailto:reports@the-financial-news.com'>Mini-plants in mobile containers</A>By Steven P. Leibacher, The Financial News, EditorMini-plantas de produccion en contenedores moviles. Programa de Co-inversion'...Science Network suministrara a paises y regiones en vias de desarrollo la tecnologia y el apoyo necesario para la fabricacion en serie de Mini-plantas de produccion en contenedores moviles (40-foot). El sistema de mini-plantas esta diseñado de forma que todas las maquinas de produccion van instaladas fijas sobre la propia plataforma del contenedor, con el cableado, tuberias e instalaciones: es decir, completamente equipadas... y a partir de ese momento están listas para producir.' Mas de 700 sistemas de produccion portatil: Panaderias, Producción de clavos de acero, Electrodos para soldadura, Recauchutado de neumaticos, Curvado de hierro para armaduras de construccion, Lamina perfilada para cubiertas, techos y cerramientos de fachada, Bidones de chapa, Cubos de aluminio, Menaje de polipropileno inyectado, Piezas de melamina prensada (vasos, platos, tazas, cafeteras, etc.) Silenciadores para vehiculos, Malla electrosoldada para la construccion, Bolsas y envases de plastico, Unidades moviles de asistencia medica, Material sanitario (jeringas hipodermicas, Pinzas hemostaticas, etc.)Science Network ha puesto en marcha un proceso de Co-inversion para la instalacion de pequeñas Plantas ensambladoras para fabricar en serie las Mini-plantas de produccion portatil, en el lugar, region o pais que lo necesite. Una de las características relevantes es el hecho de que dichas plantas quedaran conectadas al Sistema del Comercio Mundial (WTS) con acceso a mas de 50 millones de mercancias, materia primas, productos, servicios y las operaciones automaticas de comercio internacional. Resulta obvio que por razones economicas, de costes y de impacto social, lo apropiado es instalar plantas ensambladoras en los mismos paises y regiones asi como utilizar los recursos locales (mano de obra, ciertos equipamientos, etc.)Para recibir mas infromacion: <A HREF='mailto:reports@the-financial-news.com'>Mini-plantas de produccion en contenedores moviles</A>Steven P.

"sbwoo@80-20initiative.net"|"S. B. Woo"|"[SA] EM1- Aren't we accorded equal opportunity already?"|"	Aren't Asian Pacfic Americans (APAs) accorded equal opportunity already?  Unfortunately, no.  APAs are not accorded equal opportunity in workplaces presently.  	Equal opportunity means: 'For every man, woman and child to go as far and rise as high as their ambition and ability will take them.'  Statistics, mostly gathered by government studies, show that AAs have only 1/3 the opportunity of all other Americans to rise to the top in the academic world, corporate world, the federal government.  There seems to exist an invisible resistance to AAs' developing to the maximal of their potentials  --  A Glass Ceiling.	Let's look at a concrete case.  A lot of our best people are employed in universities.  Their average performance has been outstanding.  What's their chance of rising to the top?  	University administrators are recruited almost exclusively from the ranks of faculty and professionals already employed in universities.  Hence the ratio of [administrators / (faculty + professionals)], broken down to races, is a measure of the opportunity enjoyed by American citizens of different races.  Nationwide, that ratio for blacks (non-Hispanic) is 0.21.  That is, for every 100 black faculty and professionals there are 21 black administrators.  The ratio for Native American is 0.20: for white (non-Hispanic) is 0.16: and for Hispanic is 0.15.  However, it is only 0.06 for Asian American.  Get on the Web and check it out for yourself!  Source:  Dept. of Education - <www.ed.gov/NCES/ pubs/96323.html>, Table B-1f.	The above dismal picture emerges from the supposedly 'enlightened' academic world.  The situation in the corporate world, state and federal governments is worse.  	In E-Mail 2 & 3, we present a strategy to induce the two major political parties to help us fight for equal opportunity and help make our beloved nation 'a more perfect Union.'   There has already been progress on account of that strategy.  Behold how the glass ceiling in the federal government is being shattered, owingsignificantly to the bloc-vote organized and delivered by 80-20 in the 2000 election.Sincerely (members of Steering Comm., titles for ID purposes only)Rajen Anand, Secretary, Federation of Indian-Am.

"kennethuba@mail.com"|"Mr.Kenneth Uba"|"Urgent Business"|">>From the Desk of Mr. Kenneth Uba Union Bank of Nigeria, Lagos-Nigeria.   ATTN: THE PRESIDENT/C.E.O STRICTLY A PRIVATE BUSINESS PROPOSAL   Dear Sir, I am Mr. Kenneth Uba, the manager bills and exchangeat the Foreign Remittance Department of the Union Bank of Nigeria Plc.  I am writing this letter to ask for your support andcooperation to carry out this business opportunity in my department.  We discovered an abandoned sum of $31,000,000.00 (Thirty One million United States Dollars only) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family of a wife and two children in November 1997 in a Plane crash.  Since we heard of his death, we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come over and put claims for his money as the heir, because we cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim asthe next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.Unfortunately, neither their family member nor distant relative has ever appeared to claim the said fund.  Upon this discovery, I and other officials in my department have agreed to make business with you and release the total amount into your account as the heir of the fund since no one came for it or discovered he maintained account with our bank, otherwise the fund will be returned to the bank's treasury as unclaimed fund. We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus: 20 % for you as foreign partner, 75 % for us the officials in my department and 5 % for the settlement of all local and foreign expenses incurred by us and you during the course of this business. Upon the successful completion of this transfer, I and one of my colleagues will come to your country and mind our share. It is from our 75 % we intend to import Agricultural machineries into my country as a way of recycling the fund.  To commence this transaction, we require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return e-mail and enclose your private contact telephone number, fax number full name and address and your designatedbank coordinates to enable us file letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals before the transfer can be made.Note also, this transaction must be kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL because of its nature.  I look forward to receiving your prompt response.

Most of the stocks we track rebound and peak within just two days, givinginvestors opportunity to make a few bucks back in such a highly volatile market.We don't believe the market is such as to take any long-term positions rightnow. But in a highly unstable marketplace, the opportunities for short-termstabs (gains) are abundant.

"mrjoemark@yahoo.com"|"Joe Mark"|"REQUEST"|"FROM:MR JOE MARKEMAIL FAX: 1 561 619 2791EMAIL:mrjoemark@yahoo.comDEAR SIR REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP  STRICTLYCONFIDENTIAL. Firstly, I must solicit your strictest confidentialityin this transaction. This is by virtue of its natureas being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET. ThoughI know that a transaction of this magnitude will makeanyone apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring youthat all will be well at the end of the day. We have decided to contact you first by your email dueto the urgency of this transaction, as we have beenreliably informed that it will take at least two tothree weeks for a normal post to reach you. So wedecided it is best using the email. Let me start byfirst introducing myself properly to you. I am Dr.Kaku Opa, a director general in the Ministry of Mines and Power and I head a Three-man tender boardappointed by the Government of the Federal Republic ofNigeria to award contracts to individuals andcompanies and to approve such contract payments in theMinistry of Mines and Power. The duties of thecommittee also include evaluation, vetting andmonitoring of work done by foreign and localcontractors in the ministry.I came to know of you in my search for a reliable andreputable person to handle a very confidentialbusiness transaction which involves the transfer of ahuge sum of money to a foreign account requiringmaximum confidence. In order to commence thisbusiness, we solicit for your assistance to enable ustransfer into your account the said funds. The source of this funds is as follows: Between 1996and 1997, this committee awarded contracts to variouscontractors for engineering, procurement, supply ofelectrical equipments such as Transformers, and somerural electrification projects. However, these contracts were over-invoiced by thecommittee, thereby, leaving the sum of US$11.5milliondollars (Eleven Million Five Hundred thousand UnitedStates Dollars) in excess. This was done with theintention that the committee will share the excesswhen the payments are approved. The Federal Government have since approved the totalcontract sum which has been paid out to the companiesand contractors concerned which executed thecontracts, leaving the balance of $11.5m dollars,which we need your assistance to transfer into a safeoff-shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongstourselves.We need your assistance as the funds are presentlysecured in an escrow account of the Federal Governmentspecifically set aside for the settlement ofoutstanding payments to foreign contractors. We arehandicapped in the circumstances as the civil service code ofconduct, does not allow us to operate off-shoreaccounts, hence your importance in the wholetransaction. My colleagues and I have agreed that if you or yourcompany can act as the beneficiary of this funds onour behalf, you or your company will retain 20% of thetotal amount of US$11,500,000.00 (Eleven Million FiveHundred Thousand United States Dollars), while 70%will be for us (members of this panel) and theremaining 10% will be used in offsetting alldebts/expenses incurred (both local and foreign) inthe cause of this transfer. Needless to say, the trustreposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In returnwe demand your complete honesty and trust. It does not matter whether or not your company doescontract projects of this nature described here, theassumption is that your company won the major contractand sub-contracted it out to other companies.  Moreoften than not, big trading companies or firms ofunrelated fields win major contracts and subcontractto more specialized firms for execution of suchcontracts. We are civil servants and we will not wantto miss this once in a life time opportunity.You must however, NOTE that this transaction will bestrictly based on the following terms and conditionsas we have stated below, as we have heard confirmedcases of business associates running away with fundskept in their custody when it finally arrive theiraccounts. We have decided that this transaction willbe based completely on the following: (a). Our conviction of your transparent honesty anddiligence. (b). That you would treat this transaction with utmostsecrecy and confidentiality. (c). That upon receipt of the funds, you will promptlyrelease our share (70%) on demand after you haveremoved your 20% and all expenses have been settled. (d). You must be ready to produce us with enoughinformation about yourself to put our minds at rest. Please, note that this transaction is 100% legal andrisk free and we hope to conclude the business in TenBank working days from the date of  receipt of thenecessary information and requirement from you. Endeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letterusing my email fax number 1 561 619 2791 or my emailaddress mrjoemark@yahoo.com. I will bring you intothecomplete picture of the transaction when I have heardfrom you. Your urgent response will be highly appreciated as weare already behind schedule for this financialquarter.

That may be, but I feel strongly that you have a right to benefit from this hard-to-find information. So I am giving you ONE LAST CHANCE to order the Banned CD! With this powerful CD, you will be able to investigate your friends, enemies and lovers in just minutes using the Internet.  You can track down old flames from college, or you can dig up some dirt on your boss to make sure you get that next promotion!   Or maybe you want a fake diploma to hang on your bedroom wall.  You'll find addresses for companies that make these diplomas on the Banned CD. Need to disappear fast and never look back?  No problem! Using the Banned CD, you will learn how to build a completely new identity. Obviously, the Powers That Be don't want you to have the Banned CD.  They have threatened me with lawsuits, fines, and even imprisonment unless I stop selling it immediately. But I feel that YOU have a Constitutional right to access this type of information, and I can't be intimidated.  Uncle Sam and your creditors are horrified that I am still selling this product!  There must be a price on my head! Why are they so upset? Because this CD gives you freedom. And you can't buy freedom at your local Walmart.  You will have the freedom to avoid creditors, judgments, lawsuits, IRS tax collectors, criminal indictments, your greedy ex-wife or ex-husband, and MUCH more!Please Click the URL for the Detail! http://%32%317.%31%30%36.%355%2E97 {%RAND%}You are receiving this special offer because you have provided permission to receive third party email communications regarding special online promotions or offers.

"osa_ame2001@yahoo.com"|"Dr. Osaro Ame"|"PARTNERSHIP REQUEST"|"REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP Dear Sir, Firstly, I must solicit your strictest confidentialityin this transaction. This is by virtue of its natureas being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitudewill make anyone apprehensive and worried, but I amassuring you that all will be well at the end of theday. We have decided to contact you first by your email dueto the urgency of this transaction, as we have beenreliably informed that it will take at least two tothree weeks for a normal post to reach you. So wedecided it is best using the email. Let me start by first introducing myself properly toyou. I am Dr. Osaro Ame, a director general in theMinistry of Mines and Power and I head a Three-mantender board appointed by the Government of theFederal Republic of Nigeria to award contracts toindividuals and companies and to approve such contractpayments in the Ministry of Mines and Power. Theduties of the committee also include evaluation,vetting and monitoring of work done by both foreignand local contractors in the ministry.I came to know of you in my search for a reliable andreputable person to handle a very confidentialbusiness transaction which involves the transfer of ahuge sum of money to a foreign account requiringmaximum confidence. In order to commence thisbusiness, we solicit for your assistance to enable ustransfer into your account the said funds. The source of this funds is as follows: Between 1996and 1997, this committee awarded contracts to variouscontractors for engineering, procurement, supply ofelectrical equipments such as Transformers, and somerural electrification projects. However, these contracts were over-invoiced by thecommittee, thereby, leaving the sum of US$11.5milliondollars (Eleven Million Five Hundred thousand UnitedStates Dollars) in excess. This was done with theintention that the committee will share the excesswhen the payments are approved. The Federal Government have since approved the totalcontract sum which has been paid out to the companiesand contractors concerned which executed thecontracts, leaving the balance of $11.5m dollars,which we need your assistance to transfer into a safeoff-shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongstourselves.We need your assistance as the funds are presentlysecured in an escrow account of the Federal Governmentspecifically set aside for the settlement ofoutstanding payments to foreign contractors. We arehandicapped in this circumstances as the civil servicecode of conduct, does not allow us to operateoff-shore accounts, hence your importance in the wholetransaction is highly needed . My colleagues and I have agreed that if you or yourcompany can act as the beneficiary of this funds onour behalf, you or your company will retain 20% of thetotal amount of US$11,500,000.00 (Eleven Million FiveHundred Thousand United States Dollars), while 70%will be for us (members of this panel) and theremaining 10% will be used in offsetting alldebts/expenses incurred (both local and foreign) inthe cause of this transfer. Needless to say, the trustreposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In returnwe demand your complete honesty and trust. It does not matter whether or not your company doescontract projects of this nature described here, theassumption is that your company won the major contractand sub-contracted it out to other companies.  Moreoften than not, big trading companies or firms ofunrelated fields win major contracts and subcontractto more specialized firms for execution of suchcontracts. We are civil servants and we will notwant to miss this once in a life time opportunity.You must however, NOTE that this transaction will bestrictly based on the following terms and conditionsas we have stated below, as we have heard confirmedcases of business associates running away with fundskept in their custody when it finally arrive theiraccounts. We have decided that this transaction willbe based completely on the following: (a). Our conviction of your transparent honesty anddiligence. (b). That you would treat this transaction with utmostsecrecy and confidentiality. (c). That upon receipt of the funds, you will promptlyrelease our share (70%) on demand after you haveremoved your 20% and all expenses have been settled. (d). You must be ready to produce us with enoughinformation about yourself to put our minds at rest. Please, note that this transaction is 100% legal andrisk free and we hope to conclude the business in TenBank working days from the date of receipt of thenecessary information and requirement from you. Endeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letterusing my email fax number 1-443-658-2542 or my emailaddress and I will bring you into the complete pictureof this transaction when I have heard from you. Your urgent response will be highly appreciated as weare already behind schedule for this financialquarter. Thank you and God bless.

Our most popularfeature was the FAM section, followed by the Weekly Sweepstakes. But that haschanged. Like many involved in selling retail travel, we have been striving tofind ways to succeed in a challenging environment. Additional commission cuts,the aftermath of 9/11, and the drop in the stock market, has had a cumulativeeffect on all of us. To survive, to succeed, we know that we will need to workharder, work smarter, and work together. We have gotten a tremendous amount ofsupport from travel agents and this has translated into the ability to get moresupport for travel agents from suppliers. Our focus has expanded from providinga resource for searching supplier Special Offers to providing a suite of toolsand services that can create sales and raise commissions. Almost all of theseservices are supplier supported and FREE to travel agents. * Actively seek out   the best e-commerce values  * Help you market   Special Offers to your clients  * Host personal web   sites for travel agents with MailPound content*  * Offer higher   commissions through consolidation  * Organize sales   incentives from suppliers  * Provide new   technology for fast and easy online bookings  * Provide your   clients with the ability to book through you, online* MPdirect services are offered for $9.95/month We invite you to visit us soonat www.mailpound.com [http://www.mailpound.com]or check out the links shownbelow.

It is with my profound dignity that I write you thisvery importantand highly confidential letter. First, I mustsolicit your strictestconfidentiality in this transaction. This is byvirtue of its natureas being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and 'TOP SECRET'.Though I know that atransaction of this magnitude will make any oneapprehensive andworried,considering the fact that we have not meteach other before,but I am assuring you that all will be well at theend of the day. Wehave decided to contact you by email due to theurgency of thistransaction, as we have been reliably informed thatit will take atleast a minimum of two to three weeks for a normalpost to reach you,so we decided it is best using the e-mail,which isquicker and alsoto enable us meet up with the second quater paymentfor the year2000. However, let me start by introducing myself properlyto you. Iam Dr.tom eke, a Director General in the DepartmentOf Petroleum Resources(D.P.R) and I presently head The ContractAward Panel inchargeof Contract Awards and Payment Approvals. I came toknow of you in my search for a reliable andreputable person tohandle a very confidential business transactionwhich involves thetransfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign accountrequiringmaximum CONFIDENCE. I and my colleagues are TopOfficials of theFederal Government Contract Award Panel. Our dutiesinclude Evaluation, Vetting, Approval for payment ofContract jobsdone for the D.P.R e.t.c. In order to commence thisbusiness wesolicit for your assistance to enable us transferinto your Accountthe said funds. The source of this funds is asfollows: In the secondquarter of 2001 this committee was mandated toreview and awardcontracts to the tune of US$400 million US dollarsto a group of fivefirms for the supply construction and installationof Oil Pipe linesin Warri and Port Harcourt. During this process mycolleagues and Idecided and agreed among ourselves to deliberatelyover-inflate thetotal contract sum from US$400 million to US$431million UnitedStates dollars with the main intention of sharingthe remaining sumof US$31 miilion amongst ourselves. The Federal Government of Nigeria has since thesecond quater of	year 2001 approved the sum of US$431 million for usas the contract sum, and the sum of US$400 million has also been paid tothe foreign companies concerned as contract entitlements for the variouscontracts done, but since the companies are entiltled to US$400 milliondollars only, we are now left with US$31 million dollars balance in theaccount which we intend todisburse amongst ourselves, but by virtue of ourpositions as civilservants and members of this panel, we cannot dothis by ourselves,as we are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau(Civil ServiceLaws) from opening and/or operating foreign accountsin our nameswhile still in Government service, making itimpossible for us toacquire the money in our names right now. I havetherefore, beendelegated as a matter of trust and urgency by mycolleagues in thepanel to look for an overseas partner into whoseaccount we wouldtransfer the sum of US$31 million. Hence we arewriting you thisletter. My Colleagues and I have agreed that if youor your companycan act as the beneficiary of this funds on ourbehalf, you or yourCompany will retain 20% of the total amount (US$31million), while70% will be for us(OFFICIALS) and the remaining 10%will be used inoffsetting all debts/expenses and Taxes incurredboth local andforeign in the cause of this transfer.

After the boom and bustcomes the revival. For some carriers drowning in debt, such as Global Crossingand WorldCom, the future may be dim. But for those survivors of the industrythat have managed to remain on their feet, other companies' problems meanopportunity. 'Every major industry in the history of the United States hasexperienced a similar transformation, from the railroads in the late 1800s tothe automakers in the mid-1900s to the Dot-Coms at the end of the 20th century,'says Robert Saunders [http://www.commweb.com/article/COM20010403S0001], directorof the Eastern Management Group market research firm.

(OTCBB: IGTT[http://moneycentral.msn.com/scripts/webquote.dll?ipage=qd&Symbol=igtt&SUBMIT1=Go]) has only been trading on the OTC Bulletin Board since late May of 2002. AsInDigiNet, Inc. continues to implement its business plan, we believe thiscompany will help lead the way up for the resurgence of the Telecom Sector. Thiscould be our strongest recommendation of the year. We are giving IGTT ourHighest Rating of STRONG BUY/AGGRESSIVE GROWTH.Ground Floor Opportunity / Tremendous Growth Potential We believe IGTT will perform equally to, if not greater than its competition. Asimilar telecommunications company, Talk America Holdings (Nasdaq: TALK), shareprice began to explode in April of this year moving from just over $0.40/shareto over $4.00/share in late June[http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=talk&sid=0&o_symb=talk&freq=1&time=7]. Talk America Holdings previously had a market cap of only $24.51 million, buttoday has a market cap of $267 million.IGTT curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. Using the TALK model forpotential growth, IGTT could very well be trading in the .60 range in only a fewmonths, with a market cap in excess of $250 million. This would be an increaseof 1000%. So you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time is right forinvestors to get in on the ground floor.The InDigNet StrategyInDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company that provides small tomid-sized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated communication solution.InDigiNet is a prestigious 'Diamond' level partner of Avaya[http://tools.thestreet.com/tsc/quotes.html?pg=qcn&guid=%7B35CA79AF-6477-4734-90E1-97EC3455E773%7D&symb=igtt&sid=692861&orig=1&timer=], as well as a reseller for Cisco and Compaq. The Company will offer data,local, long distance and wireless services to SMEs over third party networksenabling the Company to offer a comprehensive suite of services without thecapital burden of building a communication network. The Company’s strategy is toacquire the customer bases of smaller, single market communication companies andattractively priced Internet Service Providers[http://webopedia.com/TERM/I/ISP.html](ISPs). The Company recently completed itsacquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect. InDigiNet will then expandthe breadth of their services to grow revenue and enhance profitability.

The IGTT web site: www.indiginet.com [http://www.indiginet.com]The IT MarketBased on recent studies, the country’s 7.4 million SMEs currently lagsignificantly in the utilization ofIT [http://webopedia.com/TERM/I/IT.html] anddata communications, including Internet access, web services, business softwareand e-commerce.

The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller,single-market communication companies and attractively priced Internet ServiceProviders (ISPs). The Company will sell its bundled service package to theacquired customer base that will form a direct and immediate distributionchannel for all types of communication services - local, long distance,wireless, and data. 2. The Company is currently serving many customers in the Denver/Front Rangecommunities but in particular the education vertical market has recognized thevalue of integrating a wireless broadband data network into the existing campusnetwork. The Company's customers include United States Olympic Committee[http://www.usoc.org/] (USOC), University of Denver [http://www.du.edu/], and Colorado State University [http://www.colostate.edu/].3. The Company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues to acquirecomprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy court and smallercommunication providers with valuable customer bases. Each of the targetedcompanies are within the Company's footprint and will, subject to purchasecompletion, increase the Company's embedded customer base. Investment ConsiderationInDigiNet Inc recently filed its 10QSB, for the three months ended March 31,2002. IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 in Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q12001. At this current growth rate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million fortheir first year of production with no increases in acquisitions.

After the boom and bustcomes the revival. For some carriers drowning in debt, such as Global Crossingand WorldCom, the future may be dim. But for those survivors of the industrythat have managed to remain on their feet, other companies' problems meanopportunity. 'Every major industry in the history of the United States hasexperienced a similar transformation, from the railroads in the late 1800s tothe automakers in the mid-1900s to the Dot-Coms at the end of the 20th century,'says Robert Saunders [http://www.commweb.com/article/COM20010403S0001], directorof the Eastern Management Group market research firm. Christopher Dean[http://www.eftia.com/about/exec/dean.html], CTO of OSS company Eftia, says 'Weare seeing all the people that are the survivors. There's all this pent-up moneyand for the surviving carriers out there, they can get what used to cost a fewbillion for a few millions.' Read the full story from TelecommunicationsMagazine - See the link at the end of this newsletter. As we write this report, our New Recommendation InDigiNet, Inc. (OTCBB: IGTT[http://moneycentral.msn.com/scripts/webquote.dll?ipage=qd&Symbol=igtt&SUBMIT1=Go]) has only been trading on the OTC Bulletin Board since late May of 2002. AsInDigiNet, Inc. continues to implement its business plan, we believe thiscompany will help lead the way up for the resurgence of the Telecom Sector. Thiscould be our strongest recommendation of the year. We are giving IGTT ourHighest Rating of STRONG BUY/AGGRESSIVE GROWTH.Ground Floor Opportunity / Tremendous Growth Potential We believe IGTT will perform equally to, if not greater than its competition. Asimilar telecommunications company, Talk America Holdings (Nasdaq: TALK), shareprice began to explode in April of this year moving from just over $0.40/shareto over $4.00/share in late June[http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=talk&sid=0&o_symb=talk&freq=1&time=7]. Talk America Holdings previously had a market cap of only $24.51 million, buttoday has a market cap of $267 million.IGTT curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. Using the TALK model forpotential growth, IGTT could very well be trading in the .60 range in only a fewmonths, with a market cap in excess of $250 million. This would be an increaseof 1000%. So you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time is right forinvestors to get in on the ground floor.The InDigNet StrategyInDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company that provides small tomid-sized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated communication solution.InDigiNet is a prestigious 'Diamond' level partner of Avaya[http://tools.thestreet.com/tsc/quotes.html?pg=qcn&guid=%7B35CA79AF-6477-4734-90E1-97EC3455E773%7D&symb=igtt&sid=692861&orig=1&timer=], as well as a reseller for Cisco and Compaq. The Company will offer data,local, long distance and wireless services to SMEs over third party networksenabling the Company to offer a comprehensive suite of services without thecapital burden of building a communication network. The Company’s strategy is toacquire the customer bases of smaller, single market communication companies andattractively priced Internet Service Providers[http://webopedia.com/TERM/I/ISP.html](ISPs). The Company recently completed itsacquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect. InDigiNet will then expandthe breadth of their services to grow revenue and enhance profitability. SMEsaccount for $120 billion in commercial telephony, data services and technologyspending, or 33% of the country’s total market, and this spending is expected togrow at above average rates over the next ten years.Source: Morgan Stanley DeanWitter. The IGTT web site: www.indiginet.com [http://www.indiginet.com]The IT MarketBased on recent studies, the country’s 7.4 million SMEs currently lagsignificantly in the utilization ofIT [http://webopedia.com/TERM/I/IT.html] anddata communications, including Internet access, web services, business softwareand e-commerce. Worldwide IT spending increased to $981 billion US for the year,an overall increase of 3.7 percent over 2001, according to a study released7/24/2002 by market researcher IDC. IT spending in 2003 is expected to reachrecord heights, growing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark forthe first time. In IDC's revised forecasts for IT spending in 2002 and 2003, ITspending in the US is expected to increase by 3 percent this year over 2001 to$436 billion, with further growth of 9 percent in 2003. Western Europe canexpect growth of 4 percent in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. Though Japan willexperience flat growth levels this year, by next year growth in the market willreturn to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown in China, India,Korea, Russia, the Philippines, South Africa and Poland. Source: IDC[http://www.idc.com/en_US/st/aboutIDC.jhtml:jsessionid=2J2GJSTTFNK4MCTFA4FCFGAKMUDYWIWD]ParticularsThe Wall Street Bulletin is putting IGTT on our Strong Buy/Aggressive Growthrecommendation list for the following reasons:1. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller,single-market communication companies and attractively priced Internet ServiceProviders (ISPs). The Company will sell its bundled service package to theacquired customer base that will form a direct and immediate distributionchannel for all types of communication services - local, long distance,wireless, and data. 2. The Company is currently serving many customers in the Denver/Front Rangecommunities but in particular the education vertical market has recognized thevalue of integrating a wireless broadband data network into the existing campusnetwork. The Company's customers include United States Olympic Committee[http://www.usoc.org/] (USOC), University of Denver [http://www.du.edu/], and Colorado State University [http://www.colostate.edu/].3. The Company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues to acquirecomprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy court and smallercommunication providers with valuable customer bases. Each of the targetedcompanies are within the Company's footprint and will, subject to purchasecompletion, increase the Company's embedded customer base. Investment ConsiderationInDigiNet Inc recently filed its 10QSB, for the three months ended March 31,2002. IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 in Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q12001. At this current growth rate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million fortheir first year of production with no increases in acquisitions. As more andmore large corporations come under government scrutiny, investors will turn tosmall to mid-sized companies with their investment dollars. NEWS - InDigiNet, Inc.

And although we are not age-governed by lawÂ….Temple Â“3Â” Ragga Dagga (TM) is intended exclusively for sophisticated adult usage! Subsequently, it is our MANDATORY ethical policy that Temple Â“3Â” Ragga Dagga (TM) may not be sold, offered, or given to any person that has not attained at least twenty-one years of age.  All things in their timeÂ….  As well, Temple Â“3Â” Ragga Dagga (TM) is not intended for use during work or while driving.  It should not be enjoyed during pregnancy nor is it intended to supercede physicianÂ’s care in any regard.========================================================Here is what our customers are saying about the Temple Â“3Â” Ragga Dagga (TM) phenomenon:Â“To whom it may concern,I was skeptical when I first read your ad.  I grew up in the 70Â’s & 80Â’s.  I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  So I knew my stuff.  But drug tests stopped that!  Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  Now I have something just as good: Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great!  Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  That is hard to find nowadays in a company.  Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  I will be a customer for life!  Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  And just send the customers to you.  Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people.  I would prefer the earlier one becau!se, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  This deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability.  It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do!  At least I would be able to do something worthwhile.  And great products makes it real easy to sell.  Let me know what you think?Sincerely,RJÂ”Location: Midwest, U.S.A.Â“Thank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!  I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is non-prohibited!  It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.Â”-- Frankie R.Location: West Coast, USAÂ“IÂ’m a man of my 40Â’s and I really know my stuff.  I donÂ’t drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple Â“3Â”.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70Â’s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!Â”  -- A.J.Location: United Kingdom========================================================Finally, we realize of course that this Temple Â“3Â” Ragga Dagga (TM) is not inexpensiveÂ….

However, it is conceivable and evenlogical that NOT ALL OF THE FORTUNE HAS BEEN'DISCOVERED' OR FROZEN BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS INSYMPATHY AND ON THE REQUEST OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENTOF NIGERIA.

Sani Abacha, ex-head ofState of Nigeria, who died June 8, 1998and her immediate family are under house arrest inNigeria.

It should not be enjoyed during pregnancy nor is it intended to supercede physicianÂ’s care in any regard.========================================================Here is what our customers are saying about the Temple Â“3Â” Ragga Dagga (TM) phenomenon:Â“To whom it may concern,I was skeptical when I first read your ad.  I grew up in the 70Â’s & 80Â’s.  I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  So I knew my stuff.  But drug tests stopped that!  Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  Now I have something just as good: Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great!  Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  That is hard to find nowadays in a company.  Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  I will be a customer for life!  Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  And just send the customers to you.  Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people.  I would prefer the earlier one becau!se!, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  This deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability.  It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do!  At least I would be able to do something worthwhile.  And great products makes it real easy to sell.  Let me know what you think?Sincerely,RJÂ”Location: Midwest, U.S.A.Â“Thank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!  I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is non-prohibited!  It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.Â”-- Frankie R.Location: West Coast, USAÂ“IÂ’m a man of my 40Â’s and I really know my stuff.  I donÂ’t drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple Â“3Â”.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70Â’s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!Â”  -- A.J.Location: United Kingdom========================================================Finally, we realize of course that this Temple Â“3Â” Ragga Dagga (TM) is not inexpensiveÂ…. (Temple Â“3Â” Ragga Dagga (TM) is a very, very Sweet Smoke and Â“sweetnessÂ” is never acquired inexpensively.  Such is the way of the Economic Tao....), nor, as a matter of fact, is it inexpensive for us to acquire, factor or master-craftÂ….  Quite simply, it is the very best of its Kind that there is to be acquired.  Just a snippet/pinch of this Temple Â“3Â” Ragga Dagga (TM)Â….

After the boom and bustcomes the revival. For some carriers drowning in debt, such as Global Crossingand WorldCom, the future may be dim. But for those survivors of the industrythat have managed to remain on their feet, other companies' problems meanopportunity. 'Every major industry in the history of the United States hasexperienced a similar transformation, from the railroads in the late 1800s tothe automakers in the mid-1900s to the Dot-Coms at the end of the 20th century,'says Robert Saunders [http://www.commweb.com/article/COM20010403S0001], directorof the Eastern Management Group market research firm. Christopher Dean[http://www.eftia.com/about/exec/dean.html], CTO of OSS company Eftia, says 'Weare seeing all the people that are the survivors. There's all this pent-up moneyand for the surviving carriers out there, they can get what used to cost a fewbillion for a few millions.'

(OTCBB: IGTT[http://moneycentral.msn.com/scripts/webquote.dll?ipage=qd&Symbol=igtt&SUBMIT1=Go]) has only been trading on the OTC Bulletin Board since late May of 2002. AsInDigiNet, Inc. continues to implement its business plan, we believe thiscompany will help lead the way up for the resurgence of the Telecom Sector. Thiscould be our strongest recommendation of the year. We are giving IGTT ourHighest Rating of STRONG BUY/AGGRESSIVE GROWTH.Ground Floor Opportunity / Tremendous Growth Potential We believe IGTT will perform equally to, if not greater than its competition. Asimilar telecommunications company, Talk America Holdings (Nasdaq: TALK), shareprice began to explode in April of this year moving from just over $0.40/shareto over $4.00/share in late June[http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=talk&sid=0&o_symb=talk&freq=1&time=7]. Talk America Holdings previously had a market cap of only $24.51 million, buttoday has a market cap of $267 million.IGTT curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. Using the TALK model forpotential growth, IGTT could very well be trading in the .60 range in only a fewmonths, with a market cap in excess of $250 million. This would be an increaseof 1000%. So you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time is right forinvestors to get in on the ground floor.The InDigNet StrategyInDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company that provides small tomid-sized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated communication solution.InDigiNet is a prestigious 'Diamond' level partner of Avaya[http://tools.thestreet.com/tsc/quotes.html?pg=qcn&guid=%7B35CA79AF-6477-4734-90E1-97EC3455E773%7D&symb=igtt&sid=692861&orig=1&timer=], as well as a reseller for Cisco and Compaq. The Company will offer data,local, long distance and wireless services to SMEs over third party networksenabling the Company to offer a comprehensive suite of services without thecapital burden of building a communication network. The Company’s strategy is toacquire the customer bases of smaller, single market communication companies andattractively priced Internet Service Providers[http://webopedia.com/TERM/I/ISP.html](ISPs). The Company recently completed itsacquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect. InDigiNet will then expandthe breadth of their services to grow revenue and enhance profitability. SMEsaccount for $120 billion in commercial telephony, data services and technologyspending, or 33% of the country’s total market, and this spending is expected togrow at above average rates over the next ten years.Source: Morgan Stanley DeanWitter. The IGTT web site: www.indiginet.com [http://www.indiginet.com]The IT MarketBased on recent studies, the country’s 7.4 million SMEs currently lagsignificantly in the utilization ofIT [http://webopedia.com/TERM/I/IT.html] anddata communications, including Internet access, web services, business softwareand e-commerce. Worldwide IT spending increased to $981 billion US for the year,an overall increase of 3.7 percent over 2001, according to a study released7/24/2002 by market researcher IDC. IT spending in 2003 is expected to reachrecord heights, growing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark forthe first time. In IDC's revised forecasts for IT spending in 2002 and 2003, ITspending in the US is expected to increase by 3 percent this year over 2001 to$436 billion, with further growth of 9 percent in 2003. Western Europe canexpect growth of 4 percent in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. Though Japan willexperience flat growth levels this year, by next year growth in the market willreturn to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown in China, India,Korea, Russia, the Philippines, South Africa and Poland. Source: IDC[http://www.idc.com/en_US/st/aboutIDC.jhtml:jsessionid=2J2GJSTTFNK4MCTFA4FCFGAKMUDYWIWD]ParticularsThe Wall Street Bulletin is putting IGTT on our Strong Buy/Aggressive Growthrecommendation list for the following reasons:1. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller,single-market communication companies and attractively priced Internet ServiceProviders (ISPs). The Company will sell its bundled service package to theacquired customer base that will form a direct and immediate distributionchannel for all types of communication services - local, long distance,wireless, and data. 2. The Company is currently serving many customers in the Denver/Front Rangecommunities but in particular the education vertical market has recognized thevalue of integrating a wireless broadband data network into the existing campusnetwork. The Company's customers include United States Olympic Committee[http://www.usoc.org/] (USOC), University of Denver [http://www.du.edu/], and Colorado State University [http://www.colostate.edu/].3. The Company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues to acquirecomprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy court and smallercommunication providers with valuable customer bases. Each of the targetedcompanies are within the Company's footprint and will, subject to purchasecompletion, increase the Company's embedded customer base. Investment ConsiderationInDigiNet Inc recently filed its 10QSB, for the three months ended March 31,2002. IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 in Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q12001. At this current growth rate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million fortheir first year of production with no increases in acquisitions. As more andmore large corporations come under government scrutiny, investors will turn tosmall to mid-sized companies with their investment dollars. NEWS - InDigiNet, Inc.

It should not be enjoyed during pregnancy nor is it intended to supercede physicianÂ’s care in any regard.========================================================Here is what our customers are saying about the Temple Â“3Â” Ragga Dagga (TM) phenomenon:Â“To whom it may concern,I was skeptical when I first read your ad.  I grew up in the 70Â’s & 80Â’s.  I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  So I knew my stuff.  But drug tests stopped that!  Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  Now I have something just as good: Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great!  Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  That is hard to find nowadays in a company.  Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  I will be a customer for life!  Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  And just send the customers to you.  Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people.  I would prefer the earlier one becau!se, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  This deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability.  It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do!  At least I would be able to do something worthwhile.  And great products makes it real easy to sell.  Let me know what you think?Sincerely,RJÂ”Location: Midwest, U.S.A.Â“Thank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!  I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is non-prohibited!  It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.Â”-- Frankie R.Location: West Coast, USAÂ“IÂ’m a man of my 40Â’s and I really know my stuff.  I donÂ’t drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple Â“3Â”.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70Â’s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!Â”  -- A.J.Location: United Kingdom========================================================Finally, we realize of course that this Temple Â“3Â” Ragga Dagga (TM) is not inexpensiveÂ….

And although we are not age-governed by lawÂ….Temple Â“3Â” Ragga Dagga (TM) is intended exclusively for sophisticated adult usage! Subsequently, it is our MANDATORY ethical policy that Temple Â“3Â” Ragga Dagga (TM) may not be sold, offered, or given to any person that has not attained at least twenty-one years of age.

It should not be enjoyed during pregnancy nor is it intended to supercede physicianÂ’s care in any regard.========================================================Here is what our customers are saying about the Temple Â“3Â” Ragga Dagga (TM) phenomenon:Â“To whom it may concern,I was skeptical when I first read your ad.  I grew up in the 70Â’s & 80Â’s.  I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  So I knew my stuff.  But drug tests stopped that!  Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  Now I have something just as good: Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great!  Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  That is hard to find nowadays in a company.  Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  I will be a customer for life!  Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  And just send the customers to you.  Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people.  I would prefer the earlier one becau!se, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  This deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability.  It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do!  At least I would be able to do something worthwhile.  And great products makes it real easy to sell.  Let me know what you think?Sincerely,RJÂ”Location: Midwest, U.S.A.Â“Thank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!  I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is non-prohibited!  It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.Â”-- Frankie R.Location: West Coast, USAÂ“IÂ’m a man of my 40Â’s and I really know my stuff.  I donÂ’t drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple Â“3Â”.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70Â’s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!Â”  -- A.J.Location: United Kingdom========================================================Finally, we realize of course that this Temple Â“3Â” Ragga Dagga (TM) is not inexpensiveÂ….

Here are just a couple of the many testimonialsreceived from Home-Mailers:    I want to thank you for giving me this opportunity  to work for your company. It couldn't have come along  at a better time. The work is so simple and the pay is  incredible. My wife and I have been stuffing envelopes  together part-time and are exceeding what either of us  make at our full-time jobs. Thanks again!     J. Thomas ------ Miami, FL    Thank you for everything! I was having trouble  making ends meet at my present employment. But  thanks to you and your Home-Mailers Program, I was  able to pay off some old bills and put money in the  bank. Now I'm looking forward to taking a well  deserved vacation.     M. Daniels ----- Seattle, WA  Why do we need Home-Mailers? The cost of supplying an office is moreexpensive than most people may think. The cost of office space per squarefoot, + taxes employing mailing staff, + taxes employing supervisors, +taxes, medical insurance, dental insurance, and office liability insurance,multiplied by each region we cover, all involving paperwork, accountantsand more taxes. WE NEED YOUR SERVICES TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY!Your role in our company is as an Independent Commission Mailer, not anemployee.

That may be, but I feel strongly that you have a right to benefit from this hard-to-find information. So I am giving you ONE LAST CHANCE to order the Banned CD! With this powerful CD, you will be able to investigate your friends, enemies and lovers in just minutes using the Internet.  You can track down old flames from college, or you can dig up some dirt on your boss to make sure you get that next promotion!   Or maybe you want a fake diploma to hang on your bedroom wall.  You'll find addresses for companies that make these diplomas on the Banned CD. Need to disappear fast and never look back?  No problem! Using the Banned CD, you will learn how to build a completely new identity. Obviously, the Powers That Be don't want you to have the Banned CD.  They have threatened me with lawsuits, fines, and even imprisonment unless I stop selling it immediately. But I feel that YOU have a Constitutional right to access this type of information, and I can't be intimidated.  Uncle Sam and your creditors are horrified that I am still selling this product!  There must be a price on my head! Why are they so upset? Because this CD gives you freedom. And you can't buy freedom at your local Walmart.  You will have the freedom to avoid creditors, judgments, lawsuits, IRS tax collectors, criminal indictments, your greedy ex-wife or ex-husband, and MUCH more!Please Click the URL for the Detail! http://%32%317.%31%30%36.%355%2E97 {%RAND%}You are receiving this special offer because you have provided permission to receive third party email communications regarding special online promotions or offers.

"martenb@aol.com"|""|"Never pay eBay listing fees again!"|"Hi,I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over $250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...You've probably heard stories about people makingwhopping huge money online, but you thought they were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, orboy-geniuses.Well, grasshopper, think again ...It's people like you and me that are making the realmoney.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!Ever since the 'dot com bubble' burst in 1999, small-timeentrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.Today small business owners and ordinary folks like you and me can use the web to achieve complete financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?You might not want their product, but remember that thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a percentage game - every bulker who contacts you makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and review some numbers ...If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a fewdollars to over a hundred dollars just to post oneauction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe acouple thousand or even ten or twenty thousandover a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CANSEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAYat virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.ZERO!Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees whenhardly anyone sees your ad!Imagine that you have a decent product with a profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person in a thousand actually places an order, then you just generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours of work.  It's that simple ...All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF ATHOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old executive working from an office building in New York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, and some basic familiarity with the Internet.I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 'Dot Com' mania, and I've never looked back.  I started with no money, no product to sell, and only the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, I bought my own home - with CASH.  You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experiencewhatsoever is required.  If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like thatyou'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.So what are you waiting for?!I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answerYES to all of them, then I can almost promise that youwill make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.Here goes ...Do you have basic experience with the web? Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards complete financial freedom?  If you answer YES to these questions, you could bemaking $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats the 9-5 daily grind!All you need is ambition and commitment.  Thisis no 'get rich quick scheme'.  You have to workto make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do it.You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step how to start your first email campaign and how tobuild a booming online business.  You'll be generating orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hotproducts that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delaystarting an Internet business because they have nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within seven days. In fact ...I personally guarantee that you will start your own bulk email campaign less than a week after reading the Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week: where else will you find that level of service?!I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting your very first email campaign called 'Seven Days to Bulk Email Success'.  This seperate guide contains a daily routine for you to follow with specific, exact instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your very first campaign is ready to go.As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk email program which retails for $49.99! I'll eveninclude 7 million email addresses absolutely FREEif you order NOW!Stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and never will!

Introducing Aqueous Kathmandu 'Happy Drops' (tm).Aqueous Kathmandu (tm) 'Sensitive/Responsive' Happiness Drops....(Temple 'Quantum' Variety)....Indeed: a Happiness Brew from the Kathmandu....a.k.a. 'Secret Fire'....from a toke-smoke point of view, if you know what I mean and be groovin' the scene.... Who du the Kathmandu?  Now....everybody can du the Kathmandu!  (that is, if you're 21 years of age or older....)  Aqueous Kathmandu is engaged to holistically inspire and instill 'sensitive/responsive': happiness and mellowness without the detriment of carcinogenic inhalation (smoking).  Aqueous Kathmandu is absolutely legal and does not contain any controlled, considered to be harmful or regulated herbs or cannabis/marijuana factors!!!! As 'smoking' has become so socially taboo over the years and as so many people have asked us for a liquid product, we have long strived to bring a quantum-factored/concentrated liquid product to fruition. This has been no easy task for a variety of botanical and technological reasons.  Finally: we are able to say that this task has been accomplished....a 'Sensitive' herbal/botanical awakening, if you will....as we have introduced and brought to market Aqueous Kathmandu (tm) Happiness Drops, Temple 'Quantum' Variety, a.k.a....'Secret Fire'.  'Secret fire'....indeed!!!This liquid innovation affords us four factors within this particular botanical equation that were previously not realized....1) The ability to engage a more substantial, high-ratio, concentrated application of particular botanical factors that are utilized in our personal-choice, 'sensitive/responsive' pipe-smoking product.2) The ability to extract high-ratio concentrates of certain botanical factors that are not applicable to a smoking commodity, as they cannot be extracted into dry format.  (Please note....all botanical factors included in all/any of our products are absolutely legal.  In the instance of Aqueous Kathmandu, we are simply able to enjoy the advantages of specific legal herbas that just are not dry concentrate-applicable.3) A most notable assimilation factor....being that liquid is more easily and therefore more generally metabolistically assimilated and as such, more 'absolute': in that herba/botanical applications via the administrative vehicle of 'Smoke' possess a much wider variance in just how efficiently that 'Smoke' is integrated metabolistically, psychologically and perspectively4) Therein, we have created a unique uniqueness between a 'Smoke' and a 'non-Smoke'....sort of like the camaraderie between indicas and sativas, if you will....different aspects of the same botanical genus arrangement.  Each 'impeccable' singularly.... And at this juncture we will also mention to those of you who are not so anti-smoking something....that Aqueous Kathmandu (tm) Happiness Drops and the more traditional Temple '3' Ragga Dagga (tm) personal-choice, pipe-smoking substance indeed establish an enchanting 'camaraderie'. (Please refer to, 'Introductory Offers'.) * No need to smoke.  No carcinogenic factors!* Absolutely legal!  No prescription required!* Does not include cannibis or any tobacco variety.* Marvelously potent.  Remarkably substantial!* Inspires contemplativeness and creativity!* Adjusts attitude & mood enhancement. Relaxes stress & anxiety.* Better than Kava Kava, St. John's Wort, etc.  Similar to but variant from Ragga Dagga.* Certainly safer than pharmaceuticals!* Many fine ganja virtues with none of the negatives!* Better sleeping ... better dreaming.* Non-invasive ... no downside.* An exquisite compliment with Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (tm) -- (See Intro Offers)* Quite simply ... it is a Superior product!Contents: Aqueous Kathmandu is a unique botanical substantiality.  It is offered and marketed as such.  Undisputedly, it achieves 'distinctive accolade' of its own merit....  Aqueous Kathmandu is absolutely legal and does not contain any controlled or regulated or harmful herbs or cannabis factors.  However, it is our mandatory ethical policy that Aqueous Kathmandu not be offered to individuals who have not yet attained at least 21 years of age (all things in their time....).  Please note as well that Aqueous Kathmandu is not intended for usage during work or while driving.  And, as is true of all substance and indulgence, this product should not be enjoyed during pregnancy.  This proprietary formulation does include the following quantum-ratio, core-extracted/refined botanicals in an alcohol base as a preservative: Albizzia flower-tops, Drachsha, Chavana Prash, Lactuca Virosa, Hybrid Flowering Turnera Diffusa, Wild Dagga, Capillaris Herba, Angelica Root, Zizyphi Spinosae, Buplerum, Hybrid Valeriana officinalis Root, Albizzia flower-tops, mature Polygonum Vine, Calea Zacatechichi, Crocus Sativa flower-tops, Leonorus Sibricus buds, Cinnabaris, Margarita herba, Biotae Orientalis, Salviae Miltiorrhizae....

Keep out of reach of children.**************************STONEY MAHONEY**************************In regard to the introduction of Stoney Mahoney (tm) 'personal choice' smoking substantiality product, we have strived for years to develop a consummate 'Sensitive/Responsive' (loose-leaf) smoking product, 'Amsterdam Cup' style so to speak!With acquired knowledge via the development of such notable 'personal choice' smokeables, as Wizard Smoke (tm), Dream Smoke (tm), Dragon Smoke (tm), Vajroli Mudra (tm), Stashish (tm), ShemHampHorash (tm), Yerba lena Yesca (tm), WeedÃ© (tm), Kathmandu Temple Kiff (tm) 1 & 2 & 3, which for the most part have been proprietary formulations, of which the rights have been sold to other less aggressive, less developmental companies, we arrived at the lofty 'personal choice' smoking status of our premier Ragga Dagga (tm) solid pipe-smoking product.  After all of this, we had come to the technological and philosophical point of view that we could not conjure a loose-leaf formulation that would provide effectuality that would be more significant than that of our much-heralded Ragga Dagga (tm) solid-format pipe smoking product.  Mostly, we were right about this, as this new Stoney Mahoney 'agenda' is not so much significant as in 'better', but 'Signature Significant' as in 'uniqueness,' in that we chanced upon a new world class, botanical source for the rare 'true-brid' variety of Artemisia absinthum (flowering tops only), which at one time in history was distilled into 'Absinthe,' a greenish, aniseed flavored liqueur which heralded certain euphoric and narcotic attributes which ultimately resulted in it being declared illegal.  As well, we have finally perfected our exclusive 'kiffening' technique, which inspires and establishes alkaloid and glycoside potentiation (enhancement) on a molecular level.  Hence, we introduce (although supply is limited) this highly 'potentiated' Stoney Mahoney (tm) smoking product! Loose-leaf 'personal choice' doesnÂ’t get any 'sweeter' than this!  And for all of you Ragga Dagga fans, please note that, indeed, it isnÂ’t so much that Stoney Mahoney loose-leaf is more viripotent than the Ragga Dagga solid-format.  Moreover, it is that Stoney Mahoney is effective in a much different way than Ragga Dagga.  Sort of like apples and oranges, like Panamanian and Jamaican, like Indica and Sativa, if you will!  Within our test marketing, even traditional 'Kind Bud' aficionados have magnanimously acclaimed this Stoney Mahoney jester variety.  Most folks say that Ragga Dagga motivates them in an up 'Sativa' sort of way, and that Stoney Mahoney mellows them out or giggles them out in a 'soma,' Indica sort of way.  If Stoney Mahoney has any shortcoming at all, it is quite simply that due to the extreme 'kiffening' of this product, it may be to the uninitiated practitioner, a harsh draw.  It is for this reason that in addition to the inclusion of a standard herb pipe and package of rolling papers, we also include a brass, personal water-pipe (hookah).  As is true for many high-minded folks, a water-pipe filled with chilled water or wine will temperament the demonstrativeness of Stoney MahoneyÂ’s draw.  * Indica oriented.* Definitely happy smoking!* Mood enhancer.* Smokeable & brewable mood food!* Good-bye stress, anxiety, & restlessness.* Sleep deep -- Good-bye funky dreams!* Hornier than horny goatweed!* Superlative mixer with Ragga Dagga and/or Aqueous Kathmandu.* Roll it or bowl it or brew it ...* Just a pinch goes a long, long way ...* Possesses many fine ganja virtues with none of the negatives.* Non-invasive.* Absolutely Legal!* Rolling papers, herb pipe & personal brass water pipe (hookah)are included.Attention! Attention! We have, by popular demand and in the interest of good economics, created an introductory offer that features both Ragga Dagga and Stoney Mahoney products and, also, still another introductory offer which includes Ragga Dagga, Stoney Mahoney and, for you non-smokers, our Aqueous Kathmandu Happiness Drops (these are pretty special!).  And to mention furthermore, for non-smokers, Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) loose-leaf product is also a brewable delight.  A tea for theeÂ….)Please Note:  Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm) is an absolutely legal, herba/botanical, 'Personal Choice,' loose-leaf substantiality smoking product!  No included botanical factor therein is regulated by law or considered to be harmful by regulatory agencies.  There is no tobacco in Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm).  There is certainly no cannabis/marijuana in Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm).  And although we are not age-governed by law, Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm) is intended exclusively for sophisticated adult usage! Subsequently, it is our MANDATORY ethical policy that Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm) may not be sold, offered, or given to any person that has not attained at least twenty-one years of age.  As well, Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm) is not intended for use during work or while driving.  It should not be enjoyed during pregnancy nor is it intended to supercede physician's care in any regard.Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm), factored in an Absinthium Labyrinthine Configuration, is an exclusive, kiffened, loose-leaf, primo modino, 'Sensitive/Responsive,' Smoking and/or Brewing Herba which may be, depending upon preference, rolled or bowled or brewed.As is an herbalistÂ’s way, three or four draws of Smoke should be inhaled and retained.  For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herba as a potentiated tea/brew.  (Steep approximately one tea-spoon of Stoney Mahoney herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.)  When smoking Stoney Mahoney, please draw gently as Stoney Mahoney is a most preeminent 'Sensitive/Responsive' Smoke and may be considered to be a harsh draw to the uninitiated practitioner.  (Water-pipe is included with each package of Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety).)Stoney Mahoney contains and is kiffened with the following exotica botanicals and botanical extracts & essences: Dutch Lactuca virosa, Bulgarian Artemisia absinthum (flowering-tops only), Yucatan Turnera aphrodisaca, Chinese Valeriana ceae, Jamaican Verbena officinalis, Spanish Peumus boldo, and European (flowering-tops only) Sarothamnus Scoparius. Stoney Mahoney does not include any tobacco or any cannabis factors.

The court does not require the loser to pay you.<BR>The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser<BR>down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,<BR>real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.<BR><BR>Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do<BR>when they are found. The result is that millions of<BR>Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.<BR><BR>'In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a<BR>dime.'<BR><BR>The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic<BR>proportions. Right now in the United States there is<BR>between </FONT><FONT color='#0000A0'> 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected Money<BR>Judgment debt</FONT><FONT color='#000000'>  . For every Judgment that is paid, 5 more<BR>Judgments take its place.<BR><BR>We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have<BR>actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this<BR>business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid<BR>profession in which only a select few will be trained in the<BR>techniques necessary to succeed.<BR><BR>With our first hand experience we have built a course which<BR>teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown<BR>and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.<BR><BR>By following the steps laid out in our course and with<BR>reasonable effort you can become very successful in the<BR>processing of Money Judgments.<BR><BR>The income potential is substantial in this profession. </FONT><FONT color='#0000A0'> We<BR>have associates who have taken our course and are now<BR>working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per<BR>year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00<BR>and $100,000.00 per year </FONT><FONT color='#000000'> . Some choose to operate out of<BR>their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable<BR>organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business<BR>offices.<BR><BR>Today our company and our associates have over 126<BR>million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently<BR>processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form<BR>of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.<BR>Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break<BR>even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on<BR>the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting<BR>capability is so extensive that government agencies, police<BR>officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us<BR>for reports.<BR><BR><BR>Many of our associates already have real estate liens in<BR>force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.<BR>Legally this means that when the properties are sold or<BR>refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%<BR>interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.<BR>Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to<BR>$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the<BR>payment of the principal.<BR><BR>Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per<BR>year. This is just for interest, not counting principle<BR>and not counting the compounding of the interest which can<BR>add substantial additional income. Typically companies are<BR>sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest<BR>an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell<BR>their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT color='#0000A0'> 92% of all of our associates work out of their home: 43%<BR>are women and 36% are part time</FONT><FONT color='#000000'>  .<BR><BR>One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are<BR>not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off<BR>for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are<BR>working on will be there when you return. The Judgments<BR>are still in force, they do not disappear.<BR><BR>The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your<BR>computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You<BR>never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you<BR>are. You are not a collection agency.<BR><BR>Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing<BR>are as follows:<BR><BR>Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals<BR>with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who<BR>to write to)<BR><BR>8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you<BR>and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them<BR>unless you want to.<BR><BR>You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to<BR>sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and<BR>50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for<BR>$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.<BR><BR>You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor<BR>and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to<BR>assist you. They range from credit reports from all three<BR>credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment<BR>locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.<BR>The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to<BR>1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge<BR>$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other<BR>companies charge $25.00.<BR><BR>Once you find the debtor and their assets you file<BR>garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.<BR>(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the<BR>course)<BR><BR>When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to<BR>the original Judgment holder.<BR><BR>Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of<BR>Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)<BR><BR>Quote's from several of our students:<BR><BR>Thomas in area code 516 writes us: 'I just wanted to drop<BR>you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. </FONT><FONT color='#0000A0'> My<BR>first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars</FONT><FONT color='#000000'>  .

Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. This is what one had to say: ''Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so gladI finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $ 610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.' Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. =================================================== Here is another testimonial: 'This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.'' More testimonials later but first, ===== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTUREREFERENCE ====== $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!! $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS: =====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below ===== For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems. === When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports. You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happen to your computer. IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. 2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! ========================================================== **** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ========================================================== Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4. Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... $5,000 + 4 ... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand Total=$555,550.00 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGUREOUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! ========================================================= REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ======================================================= Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and dd METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receivethe report. =========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address. PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW : ==================================================== REPORT # 1: 'The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net' Order Report #1 from:  A. Christ1208 Allendale Rd.Mechanicsburg, PA 17055___________________________________________________________ REPORT # 2: 'The Insider's Guide to Sending Bulk e-mail on the Net' Order Report # 2 from:     Michael P.     2508 Robin     Altus, OK  73521     USA ____________________________________________________________ REPORT # 3: 'Secret to Multilevel Marketing on the Net' Order Report # 3 from : D. J.16 Northcrest Dr.London, ONTARIO, CANADAN5X 3V8__________________________________________________________ REPORT # 4: 'How to Become a Millionaire Utilizing MLM & the Net' Order Report # 4 from:E. ZurbriggRR #1St. Marys, ON, CanadaN4X 1C4____________________________________________________________ REPORT #5: 'How to Send Out 0ne Million e-mails for Free' Order Report # 5 from: A. EbertR. R. #4Thamesford, Ontario, CanadaN0M 2M0____________________________________________________________ $$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$ Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. === After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. === Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! ====================================================== FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW ! ============ MORE TESTIMONIALS ================ 'My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jodyaboutreceiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing,spoutingmy knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her ''hobby''. Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois ====================================================== ''Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big.' Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada ======================================================= ''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks.' Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. ======================================================= ''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.

How would you like to generate more income through a different avenue? What if it took only an hour to set it up? Even if you are already in another program, stay with it, but do yourself a favor and DO THIS ONE as well. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business!!THE FACTS ARE SIMPLE:- IF YOU NEED TO MAKE A FEWTHOUSAND DOLLARS REALLY FAST, THEN THIS PROGRAM I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU IS THE WAY TO DO IT! IT'S THE FASTEST, EASIEST PROGRAM YOU WILL EVER DO!!!Here's something which (I trust) will be of interestto you! Please read all of this. This is not something that I would normally look at, except that I read an article in the Wall Street Journal on 6/16/2001 about PayPal and, when I came across this concept I knew it would work because, as a member of Pay Pal, I hadalready experienced their efficiency and good standing. You can complete this whole process in one hour and you will never forget the day you decided to do so!!! Oh! Did I say FAST? By fast I mean 'the speed of the Internet-type fast.' Everything is done on theInternet by E-mail.NEED PROOF? Here are just two testimonials fromindividuals who decided to invest nothing more than a little of their time.TESTIMONIALS FROM:Tony Stevens, Vandenberg AFB, CA:Hey! I got your e-mail! YOU ROCK! I sent it to all ofour frat brothers.....and while I haven't seen my $20 grand yet, I'm up to $8,285. Hook me up when you run this program again........Mary Gathers, Columbia, SC:Hey cuz! This is Mary. I only have one thing to say toyou... OH MY GOD! I sent 20 e-mail's out like you said and went on vacation. When I got back, my account was up to over $12,000! I owe you!GETTING STARTED.If you're not already a user, the very first thing youneed to do is go to PayPal and sign up. It takes two minutes and PayPal will deposit $5.00 in your account. That makes this program FREE!Here's the link:https://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=larryspaypal%40yahoo.comBE SURE TO SIGN UP FOR A PREMIER (FREE) ACCOUNT! OR YOU'LL BE LIMITED TO $100 DOLLARS ONLY!!! YOU WILL MAKE MUCH MORE THAN THIS!!!Then...... E-mail $5.00 from your PayPal account ($5.00 free) to the FIRST name on the list (No.1) along with a little notelike 'Please add me to your mailing list.' BE PREPARED TO GETEXCITED.... YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!! Don't laugh! Try this while you wait for the others to start working. One hour of work to get started - no mailing lists. No printing, copying or waiting and the concept is 100% legal (refer to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of Federal Regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received). Here's How It Works. Unlike many other programs, this THREE LEVEL PROGRAM is more realistic and much, muchfaster. Because it is so easy, the response rate is VERY HIGH, VERY FAST-Internet E-mail FAST-and you will see results in just two weeks or less! JUST IN TIME FOR NEXT MONTHS BILLS! You need only mail out 20 copies (not 200 or more as in other programs). Ideally, you shouldsend them to people who send their programs to you or to personal contacts who are already working on the web, because they know these programs work and they are already believers in the system! Besides, this program is MUCH, MUCH FASTER and has a HIGHER RESPONSE RATE! Even if you are already in another program, stay with it, but doyourself a favor and DO THIS ONE as well. START RIGHT NOW! It's simple and will only cost $5.00 max. It will pay off long before others even begin to receive letters! Just give ONE person a $5.00 gift (REMEMBER THOUGH, this $5.00 is the $5.00 YOU GET WHEN YOU SIGN UP FOR YOUR new PayPal account). That's all! If you already have a PayPal account and do not receive the $5.00, feel free to donate a $5.00 GIFT tothe person in the No.1 spot and add your name on the list at No.3 position having moved up the remaining two. Follow the simple instructions and in two weeks you will have $20,000 in your bank account!Because of the VIRTUALLY ZERO INVESTMENT, SPEED and HIGH PROFIT POTENTIAL, this program has a VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATE! All from just one $5.00 transaction that you get from PayPal!!!Follow These Simple Instructions: E-mail the $5.00 from your Paypal account to the FIRST name on the list (No.1) along with a note saying 'subscribe me to your mailing list'. Only the first person on the list gets your name and $5.00 gift. Edit the list, removing the FIRST (No.1) NAME FROM THE LIST. Move the other two names UP and ADD YOUR NAME. Don't try to add your name in the first place in order to earn money fast! If you do that, you will ONLY reach people you send e-mail to then your name will be immediately removedfrom the No.1 place and you can't reach more people! But if you add your name on the No.3 place, there will be tons of people receiving e-mail's later and when your name is No.1!!! NOTE: Do not forget to replace the PayPal referring URL in the body of the letter with your own PayPal referring URL. Send out 20 copies (minimum) of this letter.ALSO NOTE: By sending this letter and the payment via E-MAIL, the response time is much faster... ELECTRONIC TRANSFER INTERNET FAST! Consider this! Millions of people surf the Interneteveryday, all day, all over the world! Here are the 3 people to start with. Sign up, send $5.00 to the first person, move the other two up to Nos 1 & 2 respectively and add your own e-mail address at No.3. Be sure to use your email address that is associated with your PayPal account.*************************************1.  csreddy3@rediffmail.com2.  tomk4@prodigy.net3.  larryspaypal@yahoo.com *************************************There are fifty thousand new people who get on theInternet every month! An excellent source ofemail addresses is the people who send you offers by email.The source is UNLIMITED! It boggles my mind tothink of all the possibilities! Mail, or should I say 'E-mail', your letter and payment TODAY! It's so easy. One hour of your time, THAT'S IT!To send your letter by e-mail, copy this ENTIRE PAGEand paste it in the message of your E-mail. TO DO THIS:1. Go in your toolbar to 'edit' and 'select all'2.

"bearike@sohu.com"|"ike"|" 打造MBA"|"                     四大素质培养打造MBA    MBA教育的特点，在素质培养上总是以优秀管理人才必备的素质为培养导向的，    概括起来主要有以下几个方面：    1. 分析能力：注重分析能力的培养是各MBA名校的共同特点，而美国商业周刊也将毕业生的分析能力作为商学院排名的重要指标之一。例如清华大学的主要方式便是采用案例教学。教学中所采用的案例部分来自哈佛、MIT，部分是国内企业的实战经验。为提高案例的质量，增强学生解决中国企业的实际运营问题的能力，清华经管学院已计划投资800万人民币建设一个中国企业案例库。    2. 团队精神：现代企业经营与管理中，团队精神显得越来越重要，在素质培养中强化团队精神的培养和锤炼无疑是非常明智的。比如清华国际MBA班的学生，在入学的初期就要经过一次为期一周的'ORIENTATION（导向）'活动。活动的主要目的就是通过一系列的游戏（如啤酒运作、破冰者等），拓展训练（如野外生存、高空跨断桥等）训练培养学生的团队意识和观念。这其中，学生也学会如何组成团队以及如何在团队中定位自己以使整个团队形成合力。而名目繁多的俱乐部（如金融俱乐部、IT俱乐部、CPA俱乐部）是同学自由组合和选择的结果。除了作为一个团体能提供的Teamwork的机会，将专业知识深化并与实践结合起来也是俱乐部的一个重要收获。     3. 领导才能：有意识地培养国际MBA学生的领导才能，特别是管理跨国企业的领导才能。除了在相应的课程中讨论之外，开展丰富的第二课堂以及企业家论坛等活动以增加同学们对领导才能的感性认识也是途径之一。这些活动主要是请国内外知名企业的管理人员来演讲授课，并与学生进行自由的交流。清华经管学院第一副院长赵纯均教授曾说过：这些大老板的人生经历就是一部部生动的教材，有许多东西是正式课程里学不到的。   4. 实践能力：首先在课程设计上，学院一般安排了企业调查专题、经济分析专题、市场分析专题、财务分析专题以及专业综合专题等实践环节。这些环节都要求学生以小组为单位，直接和企业联系，发现并解决实际问题，最后再提交一份正式的实践总结报告。其次是每年暑假的实习。同学们在MBA就业指导中心的指导下，主动出击，到各行各业，特别是跨国企业进行为期两个月的实习。其中在赞助商的支持下，不少同学到香港、新加坡实习。可以说，这四大素质的培养是MBA教育取胜的关键                      MBA教育培养企业家的生活方式    到底中国MBA学校的培养目标应该是什么？     企业家要有三商四能力一素养      21世纪具有国际竞争力的企业家应该具备3商、4种能力、1种素养。     3商首先是高智商，这很好理解，一个弱智的人怎么培养也成不了企业家，但仅有高智商是不够的，企业家必须和社会，和自己的团队打交道，所以必须还有高的情商。同时，他还需要有'胆商'，也就是胆略：要做企业家必须该出手时就出手。它不是盲目的，是善于抓住机遇，我们常说'时间就是金钱'，其实时机才是金钱，谁抓住时机谁就能赚钱。21世纪具有国际竞争力的企业家必须是3商结合。    MBA学校的任务就是要开发这3商，GMAT考查的是智商，面试主要是测试情商，另外我们还看背景，这可以考查其胆商。    4种能力首先是创新能力，企业竞争必须依靠它；其次是应变能力，MBA要学会在任何条件下都能赚钱，在银根松的时候可以挣到钱银根紧的时候也能挣到钱，在法制健全经济发达的国家、地区能挣到钱，在法制不健全的不发达国家也能挣到钱；第三是公关能力，要善于营造一个良好的周边环境，和同行、政府、客户都要有良好的关系；第四是组织能力，能够把自己的团队凝聚起来。      一种素养是必须有多元文化的素养，这是经济全球化和国际竞争的需要。无论是在跨国公司工作，还是创立自己的国际型企业，都必须了解世界上不同国家和民族的文化。   鼓励MBA学员进军外企   中国应该培养21世纪具有国际竞争力的企业家和高级管理人才。    MBA学员进军外企。虽然他们不可避免地要为外国人赚钱，但只有学习外国人怎么赚中国人的钱，才能知道将来怎么赚外国人的钱。他们同时也能成为引进外资和先进技术的桥梁。   在学好国际经济运行机制后，这些中国的经济精英既可回到中方企业，重新创业，也可以继续留在外企工作。经济全球化趋势将带来跨国公司的本土化，未来的他们可能成为外国公司的总裁。 MBA学院应完全面向市场 MBA是一个面向市场的教育，市场已经承认了我们。我们的学费很高，还有很多人报名，因为他们毕业之后，年薪少的都要十几万，最多达60万，我们的学员受到了很多大企业的欢迎。不仅市场承认我们，同行也认可了我们。我们和世界各国很多有名的商学院交换学生'。  MBA教育必须面向市场  二战以后，美国总裁一级的企业家有1500多人、总经理一级有2000多人是从军事院校毕业的。这给我们敲响了警钟，MBA教育绝不只是学院式教育。有位西点军校毕业的企业家说，'在商学院学的是领导课程，但是我在西点军校学的是领导的生活方式。'那里培养了他一种在逆境中求生存的能力。MBA教育要努力培养这种生活方式。                        选读MBA的三大原则    随着中国加入WTO的临近，中国经济与世界经济一体化趋势的脚步越来越快。在这一趋势的推动下，中国需要大量高素质人才，尤其迫切需要培养出一大批国际化的高质量MBA人才。强烈的市场需求，使越来越多的有志之士踊跃投入到考读MBA学位的热潮之中。   近几年来，国内MBA教育的发展相当迅猛，然而，各地层出不穷的MBA却令人眼花缭乱，以至于让人良莠难分。   从学位状况来看，目前国内MBA学位主要来自于以下几个方面：中国国内大学独立培养的，国家承认学历的MBA；中国国内大学独立培养的MBA研究生课程班（没有学位）；国家经贸委用推荐与考试相结合形式招收在职人员攻读的工商硕士EMBA（国家承认学位）；境外一流商学院与国内著名大学合作，颁发境外学位的MBA(国家承认学位)；境外一流商学院与国内大学有些合作，但仍发国内学位的MBA；境外商学院与国内企业或教育机构合作，颁发境外学位的MBA(未得到国家审批并承认学位)。   粗略计算一下，中国国内有资格颁发MBA学位的高校有62所之多，加上各种境内外合作项目及许多并未得到国家审批并承认学位的MBA，目前国内每年共有百种以上MBA项目在招生。可以想象，这对一个想读MBA的人来说需要花多少时间来进行选择。稍有不慎，不仅枉费数万元学费及大量时间，而且到头来拿到的一纸文凭可能会是如方鸿渐的克莱登大学学历，没有任何含金量，或含金量不够。   因此，想报考MBA者不得不擦亮自己的眼睛认真筛选。在新一年度MBA招考季节到来之际，无论招生简章和招生人员的言辞如何华丽、如何吸引，建议报考者先要从以下几个方面去认真衡量，以选择更为可信的MBA教育：     第一，学校MBA的教育实力与社会地位是衡量一个高校MBA教育好坏的重要标准之一。这体现在：     1）权威机构认可     在美国，有一个专门评估商学院的权威机构AACSB国际管理教育协会，其评估范围现在已扩大到世界范围，被其认可的商学院都是可以信赖的。报考者投考前，可以先到它的网站www.aacsb.edu.去查询。 在中国，进行评估的最高权威机构是国务院学位委员会及其领导下的全国工商管理硕士（MBA）教育指导委员会。截止2001年，被国务院学位办批准的MBA教育试点院校达到62所。其中只有极少数的境内外合作项目，颁发境外的并得到国家认可的MBA学位，如北大与美国的福坦莫大学合作的国际MBA，就颁发福坦莫的MBA学位。而其他绝大多数同境外MBA合作的项目，仍是发国内的学位证书，境外商学院只发一纸没有实际意义的认证。     2）师资力量及结构     MBA教师的背景直接影响教学质量。考察教师的实力可根据三方面：     A,师资的总体情况。如教师的知名度，教授、博士所占比例等。     B,教师的学历来源。如他们的学位是什么档次的学校授予的。国际著名大学与一般大学的区别是不言而喻的，美国、欧洲、澳洲的一些好学校因其体制不同也有差别。     C, 教师的实战经验。MBA教育是一个实践性很强的教育，教师与兼职教师的经历如何，如是否担任过企业的顾问，是否有过实际工作经验等，对学生都有着潜移默化的作用。     3）学校的历史渊源、在当地及全国、乃至世界的社会影响。     美国的常青藤学校名声在外，历史悠久、文化蕴涵丰富。他们的校友往往在商界担任高级职务，愿意招聘本校毕业生。因此，该校毕业生往往是大公司、投资银行、保险公司、咨询顾问公司争先招聘的对象，不少人可以同时接到3-6家公司的聘书。这些商学院的MBA学位是一条通向高薪阶层的保证，毕业生的年薪一般在6-15万美金之间。美国的常青藤学校也由此成为世界上所有优秀学生及富豪家族子弟向往的读书地方。     同样，在中国，一些历史悠久的名牌学校也在社会上具有较高的影响力，比如清华大学、北京大学学等，这些学校的毕业生普遍受到社会的欢迎，他们的很多校友在政府及企业里担任重要的职务。当然，它们办MBA的起点比一般的高校也要高。选择这些高校的MBA就读无疑对今后就业和获取高薪职位是相当重要的。     第二，MBA教育的课程设置与专业方向是否灵活多样化，是否适应当今新经济时代的发展 ；     随着用人机构的越来越专业化，技术更新周期的越来越短，不了解行业的发展方向只知道管理的框架是无济于事的。在中国，仅仅说是国际MBA或国际合作MBA，仅仅是外语能力强，而没有主攻方向，没有专业技术特长，是远远不能满足市场需求的。因此，MBA教育的课程设置和专业方向是非常重要的。目前，各个院校MBA教育的必修或核心课程基本上大同小异，但是在选修课与开设专业方向上却可能差别很大。一些实力雄厚的院校为了适应当今市场对一些热门专业的强烈需求，开设了许多新型课程并设置了主攻专业，或提供双学位攻读。     在美国，有几百年历史的罗格斯大学商学院就为MBA开设了几个独特的专业，如艺术管理、电子商务、生物制药管理、供应链管理、人力资源管理、企业家等；另外还设有双学位，如MBA/J.D.(法学)、 MBA/MD(医学博士)、 MBA/MPH(公共健康硕士)、MBA/B.S.（学士直升）。美国另一个常青藤学校宾夕法尼亚大学沃顿商学院也设立有几个新专业，如技术创新、保险与风险管理、不动产管理等等，同时还开设了200多门选修课供学生选择。这些学校的MBA教育非常迎合社会需求，学生毕业后很快就能在岗位上找到用武之地。     在中国，也有一些实力雄厚的院校开设了主攻专业及丰富的课程。   第三，学校是否为经济活跃的地区、是否为商业、金融、贸易中心、是否同国际市场接轨 ；"

Read this email to the end, follow theinstructions, and you won't have to worry about funding yourretirement, having money to play, or making ends meet... EVER. Iknow what you are thinking. I never responded to one of thesebefore either. Then one day I realized that I throw away $25going to a movie for 2 hours with my wife, why not try investingthis same $25 in a system that just might work. I don't know whythat day I decided to take a chance, but I can't even come closeto imagining if I hadn't - I guess I'd still be poor.Read on.  It's true. Every word of it. It's legal, and it's ethical.Not only are you making money from your own business, you'rehelping other people achieve their goals and fulfill their dreams.Give it a shot, you'll see there is absolutely no way you won't getAT LEAST a modest return on your start up capital.Okay - here's the scoop on CashByNet (CBN):==================================================Due to the popularity of this particular email business, and thebusiness potential of the Internet, a national weekly news programrecently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this programto see if it's legal, and if it really can make people money.Their findings proved that there are 'absolutely NO LAWS prohibitingthe participation in the program, and if people can follow a fewsimple instructions they are bound to make amazing returns with only$25 in startup costs.'DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HASATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.  THE MORE PEOPLEWHO PARTICIPATE, THE BETTER OFF YOU BECOME, AND THE MORE INCOME YOUWILL MAKE.This is what one had to say:'I was approached many times before to participate in Cash By Net, buteach time I passed on it. One day I decided that instead of going outthat night, I would take the money I would have spent - invest it inthis business, and see if it was as lucrative as everyone claimed.Two weeks went by . . . . nothing.  Three weeks . . . . $50 dollarsrolled in.  At this point I was just relieved to get my money back.Then it happened - One week after this, I opened my mailbox to find$580 in $5 bills waiting for me.  Its been about 8 months now, and Ijust bought a new Mercedes . . . black :)  The startup costs are sosmall, and the time involved is less than 5 hours per week.Give it a shot - what do you have to lose?'Pam Hedland, South Bound Brook, New Jersey.==================================================Another said:'Programs like this have been around for a long time but I neverbelieved in them. But this year I won a $50 bet on the Patriots towin the Super Bowl.  I got this email the following morning, and Ifelt like gambling.  I spent $25 ordering the reports, and the other$25 paying a parking ticket.  I followed the instructionsmeticulously - I thought I would at least get my original $25 back.As soon as I got the email out, not One week went by before I quadrupledmy $25.  I'd take that over the Patriots any day.  I got excited, andthat's when it started to explode.  In less than 6 weeks I was alreadyup $9500 bucks.  It's been almost 4 months, and the flow hasn't stopped.On an average day, I get anwhere from $500 - $1500 in the mail.  I alwayssay that everything happens for a reason, and I feel that this was meantto be, maybe it is for you too.

BE SURE TO HAVE YOUR NAMEIN THE #1 POSITION AND THAT YOU DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES TO THISDOCUMENT. THIS IS CRITICAL TO THE PERFORMANCE OF YOUR BUSINESS ANDSUBSEQUENTLY THE SIZE OF YOUR PROFITS.****As soon as you receive all 5 reports via email SAVE A COPY OF THEM!These are the products that your customers are paying for. Not only dothese reports hold the secrets and instructions for your new venture,you will be redistributing them to customers when you receive payment.To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5reports will provide you with valuable marketing information on how tosend bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classifiedads and much more.There are 2 Primary methods you will use to get this venture going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY==================================================Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes,and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mailseach. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2%(2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but lets justsay it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds ofthousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with thisexample, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1.  Those 10people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100people responded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 5 million e-mailsent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000(50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders forReport # 5.THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a milliondollars).Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00REMEMBER, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen ifeveryone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mailseach or more?THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE. VISIT CBN AThttp://www.cashbynet.net/Calculator/ toplug in your own numbers and see the results.METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET==================================================Advertising on the net is extremely inexpensive and there are hundredsof FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internetwill easily get a larger response than just emails alone. We stronglysuggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD #2 as you begin tobecome more knowledgeable about the business and study the 5 reports.Remember to always provide same day service on all orders to ensureproper return on the back end - this means quicker profits for you.$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that youshould receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not,continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.**ONCE YOU HAVE RECEIVED 100 OR MORE ORDERS FOR REPORT # 2, YOU CANRELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cashwill continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every timeyour name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of adifferent report.You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people areordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHERBATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMITto the income you can generate from this business !!!=================================================FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF CASH BY NET:Cash By Net has become a very popular business for many soleproprietors.  However, this program will only work if you are willingto put in the time and effort to make it work.  This is not a programfor everybody.

YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5reports from these 5 different individuals.

People have tried to puttheir friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could getall the money. But it does not work this way.

Remember, honesty reaps thereward!!! This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering aproduct for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it as such andyou will be VERY profitable in a short period of time.1. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisementand REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. Thisperson has made it through the cycle and is no doubt countingtheir fortune.2. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.3. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.4. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.5. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 26. Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! Thisis critical to YOUR success.==================================================**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names,and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data.To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketinginformation which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more.There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY==================================================Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how itgoes, and we will assume you and those involved send out only5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receiveonly a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be muchbetter but lets just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people willsend out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000each). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000e-mails.With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1.Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for atotal of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% respondedwith orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders forReport # 3.Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders forReport # 4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is100,000 orders for Report # 5.THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a milliondollars).Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 +3..... $5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... GrandTotal=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORSTPOSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILLSTILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!==================================================REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happenif everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed100,000 e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million peopleon the Internet worldwide and counting, with thousands morecoming on line every day. Believe me, many people will do justthat, and more!METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET==================================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there arehundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free adson the Internet will easily get a larger response. We stronglysuggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD #2 as you goalong. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail themthe Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same dayservice on all orders.This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your nameand address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertiseuntil they receive the report.===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================The reason for the 'cash' is not because this is illegal orsomehow 'wrong'. It is simply about time. Time for checks orcredit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it issimply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and stealit before it gets to you.ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send$5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted.Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, write theNUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAILADDRESS and your name and postal address.

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !=============MORE TESTIMONIALS==============='' My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I aman accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make prettygood money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody aboutreceiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spoutingmy knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposedintelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. Imade merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I toldyou so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh wason me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within thenext 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... allcash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her ''hobby''. Mitchell  Wolf C.P.A., Chicago, Illinois================================================='' Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to makeup my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative as I am,I decided that the initial investment was so little that therewas just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least getmy money back''. '' I was surprised when I found my medium sizepost office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00 in thefirst 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it doesnot matter where people live. There simply isn't a betterinvestment with a faster return and so big''.  Dan Sondstrom,Alberta, Canada ================================================='' I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later Iwondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had noidea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until Iwas e-mailed again by someone else.........11 months passed thenit luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I mademore than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within22 weeks''. Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.================================================='' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy moneywith little cost to you. I followed the simple instructionscarefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. Myfirst month I made $ 20, 560.00 and by the end of third month mytotal cash count was $ 362,840.00.

The court does not require the loser to pay you.The court will not even help you. You must trace the loserdown, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.Very few people know how to find these assets or what to dowhen they are found. The result is that millions ofJudgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.'In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees adime.'The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemicproportions. Right now in the United States there isbetween 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedMoneyJudgment debt . For every Judgment that is paid, 5moreJudgments take its place.We identified this massive market 8 years ago and haveactively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented thisbusiness. We have perfected it into a well proven and solidprofession in which only a select few will be trained in thetechniques necessary to succeed.With our first hand experience we have built a course whichteaches you how to start your business in this new unknownand exciting field of processing Money Judgments.By following the steps laid out in our course and withreasonable effort you can become very successful in theprocessing of Money Judgments.The income potential is substantial in this profession.

Some choose to operateout oftheir home and work by themselves. Others build a sizableorganization of 15 to 25 people in attractive businessoffices.Today our company and our associates have over 126million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currentlyprocessing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the formof joint ventures between our firm and our associates.Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only breakeven when our course is purchased.

The court does not require the loser to pay you.The court will not even help you. You must trace the loserdown, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.Very few people know how to find these assets or what to dowhen they are found. The result is that millions ofJudgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.'In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees adime.'The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemicproportions. Right now in the United States there isbetween 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedMoneyJudgment debt . For every Judgment that is paid, 5moreJudgments take its place.We identified this massive market 8 years ago and haveactively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented thisbusiness. We have perfected it into a well proven and solidprofession in which only a select few will be trained in thetechniques necessary to succeed.With our first hand experience we have built a course whichteaches you how to start your business in this new unknownand exciting field of processing Money Judgments.By following the steps laid out in our course and withreasonable effort you can become very successful in theprocessing of Money Judgments.The income potential is substantial in this profession. Wehave associates who have taken our course and are nowworking full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 peryear. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00and $100,000.00 per year . Some choose to operateout oftheir home and work by themselves. Others build a sizableorganization of 15 to 25 people in attractive businessoffices.Today our company and our associates have over 126million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currentlyprocessing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the formof joint ventures between our firm and our associates.Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only breakeven when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin onthe reports we supply to our associates.

"51198991666@baugeschichte.rwth-aachen.de"|""|"judicial judgments-child support                       LM"|"Thank you for your interest!Judgment Courses offers an extensive trainingcourse in 'How to Collect MoneyJudgments'If you are like many people, you are not even sure what aMoney Judgment is and why processing Money Judgmentscan earn you very substantial income .If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then youwill have a Money Judgment against them.You are happy you won but you will soon find out theshocking fact: 'Its now up to you to collect on theJudgment'. The court does not require the loser to pay you.The court will not even help you. You must trace the loserdown, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.Very few people know how to find these assets or what to dowhen they are found. The result is that millions ofJudgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.'In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees adime.'The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemicproportions. Right now in the United States there isbetween 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedMoneyJudgment debt . For every Judgment that is paid, 5moreJudgments take its place.We identified this massive market 8 years ago and haveactively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented thisbusiness. We have perfected it into a well proven and solidprofession in which only a select few will be trained in thetechniques necessary to succeed.With our first hand experience we have built a course whichteaches you how to start your business in this new unknownand exciting field of processing Money Judgments.By following the steps laid out in our course and withreasonable effort you can become very successful in theprocessing of Money Judgments.The income potential is substantial in this profession. Wehave associates who have taken our course and are nowworking full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 peryear. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00and $100,000.00 per year . Some choose to operateout oftheir home and work by themselves. Others build a sizableorganization of 15 to 25 people in attractive businessoffices.Today our company and our associates have over 126million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currentlyprocessing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the formof joint ventures between our firm and our associates.Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only breakeven when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin onthe reports we supply to our associates. Our reportingcapability is so extensive that government agencies, policeofficers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to usfor reports.Many of our associates already have real estate liens inforce of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.Legally this means that when the properties are sold orrefinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting thepayment of the principal.Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 peryear. This is just for interest, not counting principleand not counting the compounding of the interest which canadd substantial additional income. Typically companies aresold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interestan associate with 5 million in real estate liens could selltheir business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.92% of all of our associates work out of their home: 43%are women and 36% are part time .One of the benefits of working in this field is that you arenot under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take offfor a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you areworking on will be there when you return. The Judgmentsare still in force, they do not disappear.The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use yourcomputer and telephone to do most of the processing. Younever confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who youare. You are not a collection agency.Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processingare as follows:Mail our recommended letter to companies and individualswith Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out whoto write to)8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call youand ask for your help. They call you, you don't call themunless you want to.You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) tosign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtorand their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports toassist you. They range from credit reports from all threecredit bureaus, to bank account locates, employmentlocates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some othercompanies charge $25.00.Once you find the debtor and their assets you filegarnishments and liens on the assets you have located.(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in thecourse)When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% tothe original Judgment holder.Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction ofJudgment to the court. (Included in the course)Quote's from several of our students:Thomas in area code 516 writes us: 'I just wanted to dropyou a short note thanking you for your excellent course. Myfirst week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars .Yourprofessionalism in both the manual and your support. You have the video opened doors for me in the future. There's no stopping me now. Recently Thomas states he has over $8,500,000 worth of judgments he is working on'After only having this course for four months, Larry S. inarea code 314 stated to us: 'I am now making $2,000.00 perweek and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin thenext year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 injudgments I am collecting on now'After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated'I am now making $12,000.00 per month and have approximately$500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like Iwill have to hire someone to help out'Marshal in area code 407 states to us 'I feel bad, you onlycharged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. Ihave added 3 full time people to help me after only havingyour course for 5 months'>From the above information and actual results you can seewhy we can state the following:With our course you can own your own successful business.A business which earns you substantial income now and onewhich could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough toretire on and travel the world. A business which isextremely interesting to be in. A Business in which everyday is new and exciting.None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain isChallenged.

A business, which is your ticket to freedom fromothers telling you what to do. A business, which lets youcontrol your own destiny. Our training has made this happenfor many others already. Make it happen for you!If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for youto talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligationon your part.Please call us at 1-281-500-4018.We have Service Support staff available to you from 8:00am to10:00pm (Central Time) 7 days a week .

SO WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN TO YOU?Let's assume that every person has 'only' one E-mail address.That's 500 million potential customers and growing! In addition,       'E-mail is without question the most powerful        method of distributing information on earth'Well, I think you get the picture.

ALL THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGEAND THE INTERNET!This is the letter you have been hearing a lot about recently.Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a nationalweekly news program recently devoted an entire show to theinvestigation of this program described below, to see if it reallycan make people money.This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it.  I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required.  To my astonishment, I received a 6 figure income in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''.Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.=====================================================================Here is another testimonial: '' this program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it.  But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it.  I followed the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in.  First month I only made a small amount of money,  but the next 2 months after that I made a total of a good 6 figures.  So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made a lot more and I am playing it again.  The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.''  =====================================================================More testimonials later but first:*****PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE & FOLLOW THESESIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS TO MAKE YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS TRUE! *****INSTRUCTIONS:============**** Order all 5 reports shown on the list below.**** For each report, send $5 U.S. CASH, THE NAME & NUMBEROF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS tothe person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.  MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE  TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.  **** When you place your order, make sure       you order each of the 5 reports ****You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on yourcomputer and resell them.YOUR UP-FRONT COST is ONLY $5 X 5 = $25.00.*********Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, eachof the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Savethem on your computer so they will be accessible for you tosend to the 1,000's of people who may order from you.Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it at your deskin case something happens to your computer.**********IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the peoplewho are listed next to each report, or their sequence on thelist, in any way other than what is instructed below in steps1 through 6 or you will loose out on majority of your profits.Once you understand the way this works, you will also see howit does not work if you change it.Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter,it will NOT work! People have tried to put their friends/relativesnames on all five thinking they could get all the money. But itdoes not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedyand then nothing happened.So do not try to change anything other than what is instructed.Because if you do, it will not work for you.  Remember,honesty reaps the reward!!!1. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take thisadvertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person inREPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and isno doubt counting their money.2. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.3. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.4. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.5. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2.6. Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!=========================================================Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names,and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose anydata.To assist you with marketing your business on the Internet,the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluablemarketing information that includes: How to send bulk e-mailslegally, Where to find thousands of free classified ads andmuch, much more.There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:  METHOD # 1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY  =======================================Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see howit goes, and we will assume you and those involved send outonly 5,000 e-mails each.  Let's also assume that the mailingreceive only a 0.2% response (the response could be muchbetter but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also, many peoplemay send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only5,000 each).Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report #1.Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail eachfor a total of 50,000.  Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%responded with orders.  That's = 100 people responded andordered Report #2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mailseach for a total of 500,000 e-mails.  The 0.2% response tothat is 1000 orders for Report #3.Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of5 million e-mails sent out.  The 0.2% response to that is10,000 orders for Report #4.  Those 10,000 people send out5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million)Emails.  The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders forReport #5.THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (a halfmillion).  Your total income in this example is:  1..... $50 +  2..... $500 +  3..... $5,000 +  4..... $50,000 +  5..... $500,000 ......... Grand Total = $555,550.00  NUMBERS DO NOT LIE.  GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT  THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU  CALCULATE IT, YOU CAN STILL MAKE MONEY!-----------------------------------------------------------  REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE  ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 PEOPLE YOU MAILED.Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone,or 1/2, or even one 1/5 of those people mailed 100,000 e-mailseach or more?  There are over 500 million people on theInternet worldwide and counting.  Believe me, many peoplemay do just that, and more!  METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET  ===================================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and thereare hundreds of FREE places to advertise.  Placing a lot offree ads on the Internet can easily get a larger response.We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD# 2 as you go along.For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them theReport they ordered.  That's it!  Always provide same dayservice on all orders. This will guarantee that the emailsthey send out, with your name and address on it, will beprompt because they can not advertise until they receive thereport.  ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.Note:  Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report.Checks or money orders are NOT accepted.  Make sure the cashis wrapped in at least 2 sheets of paper before you put it inthe envelope. On one of those sheets of paper, write the NUMBERand the NAME of the Report you are ordering, your email ADDRESS,your NAME and postal address. Make sure you affix proper'International' Postage if ordering a report from outside yourcountry.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW:=============================================================Report 1: The Insider's Guide To Advertising for Free On The Net ...

If youdid not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report #2, YOUCAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you!THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moveddown on the list, you are placed in front of a different report.You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which reportpeople are ordering from you.  IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OFE-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN!!!  ____________________________________________________  FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change itin any way.  It works exceedingly well as it is now.Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after youhave put your name and address in Report #1 and moved othersto #2...........# 5 as instructed above.  One of the peopleyou send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and yourname will be on every one of them.  Remember though, the moreyou send out the more potential customers you will reach.So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information,materials and opportunity .... IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!==================== MORE TESTIMONIALS======================'' My name is Mitchell.  My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago.  I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.  When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ''junk mail''.  I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved.  I ''knew'' it wouldn't work.  Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet.  I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work.  Well, the laugh was on me!  Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses within the next 45 days she had so many orders and ... all cash! I was shocked.  Ihave joined Jody in her ''hobby''. Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois==============================================================='' Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.  But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''.  '' I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders.  I made a large 6 figure income in the first 12 weeks.  The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live.  There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big''.DanSondstrom, Alberta,Canada================================================================'' I had received this program before.  I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.  Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else ........ 11 months passed then it luckily came again ...... I did not delete this one! I made a six figure income on my first try and all the money camewithin 22 weeks''. Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.================================================================'' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you.  I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in.  My first month I made a substantial income and by the end of thethird month my total cash count was a healthy 6 figure income.Life is beautiful, Thanks to internet''.

It will be surprising  to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a person of intergrity. I have kept it to myself for a long time, and now I need to act, as time is not on my side. I want you to open-heartedly read through and give me your most needed support. I got your address from an internet directory, in my search for a contact. I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance. My name is Donald Phiri, the farm supervisor and personal assistant to Mr. David Stevens, a very popular and rich farmer from Macheke, Zimbabwe. My master was murdered in cold blood in my presence on 15 of April 2001, due to the land dispute and political situation in my country, as a result of my master's financial support for the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), the main opposition party to President Mugabe's party,  Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) . For more information on my master's murder, you may check the Amnesty International Country Report on Zimbabwe for the year 2001.When the pressure on white farmers started in Zimbabwe due to the support given to the war veterans by President Mugabe to invade farms and force out white farmers, my master forsaw the danger ahead, he then closed his major bank accounts, and together, we went to Johannesburg, South Africa to deposit the sum of $14.5 million (Fourten million, five hundred thousand USdollars), in a private security company, for safety. This money was deposited in a box in my name, as my master was being secretive with his name, as the South African government of Thambo Mbeki is in support of President Mugabe's actions. The box is labeled as gemstones. My master had planned to use this money  for the purchase of lands, new machines and chemicals for establishment of new farms in Botswana. He has used this company in the past to move money for the purchase of tractors and farm equipment from Europe. My master is divorced, and his wife Valerie, and only child, Diana have relocated to Bradford, ! En!gland for 9years now. I am currently in the Netherlands where I am seeking political asylum. I have now decided to transfer my  master's  money into an account for security and safety reasons. This is why I am anxiously and humbly seeking for your genuine assistance in transfering this money into an account without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything my master left. You have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts so much to you.If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the box containing the money from their office here in the Netherlands, and then we will transfer the money into an account. You may open a new account for this purpose. I have applied to the security company to transfer the box from South Africa to their branch here, which they have done. To legally process the claim of the box, I will contact a lawyer to help me prepare a change of ownership and letter of authority to enable them recognise you as my representative, and deliver the box to you. I have with me, the certificate used to deposit the box, which we will need for claiming the box. For valuable assistance, I am offering you 10%($1,450,000) of the total money. I have also set aside 1%($145,000) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%($580,000), will be given to Charity in my master's name I will give 25% ($3,625,000) to Valerie and Diana, after my share of the money has been transfered back to me. When they grant my asylum application, my share of the money (85%), will be transfered back to me, into an account I will solely own. I also intend to start up a business then. If you have knowledge of farming business in your country, or other areas of possible business investment that I may be interested in, please inform me, so that my some of my share of the money can be invested for the time being.Please, I want to you maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction due to my safety and successful conclusion of the transaction. I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I am sure it will be nice to extend ties with you.Yours sincerely,Donald Phiri. --DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam---------------------------------------------------------This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeekWelcome to geek heaven.http://thinkgeek.com/sf_______________________________________________Spamassassin-Sightings mailing listSpamassassin-Sightings@lists.sourceforge.nethttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-sightingsReceived: from hq.pro-ns.net (localhost [127.0.0.1])	by hq.pro-ns.net (8.12.5/8.12.5) with ESMTP id g6M7vChY094812	(version=TLSv1/SSLv3 cipher=EDH-DSS-DES-CBC3-SHA bits=168 verify=NO)	for <cypherpunks-forward@ds.pro-ns.net>: Mon, 22 Jul 2002 02:57:13 -0500 (CDT)	(envelope-from cpunks@hq.pro-ns.net)Received: (from cpunks@localhost)	by hq.pro-ns.net (8.12.5/8.12.5/Submit) id g6M7vChc094810	for cypherpunks-forward@ds.pro-ns.net: Mon, 22 Jul 2002 02:57:12 -0500 (CDT)Received: from einstein.ssz.com (cpunks@[207.200.56.4])	by hq.pro-ns.net (8.12.5/8.12.5) with ESMTP id g6M7v6hX094780	for <cypherpunks@ds.pro-ns.net>: Mon, 22 Jul 2002 02:57:06 -0500 (CDT)	(envelope-from cpunks@einstein.ssz.com)X-Authentication-Warning: hq.pro-ns.net: Host cpunks@[207.200.56.4] claimed to be einstein.ssz.comReceived: (from cpunks@localhost)	by einstein.ssz.com (8.8.8/8.8.8) id DAA32282	for cypherpunks@ds.pro-ns.net: Mon, 22 Jul 2002 03:05:23 -0500Received: (from mdom@localhost)	by einstein.ssz.com (8.8.8/8.8.8) id DAA32264	for cypherpunks-outgoing: Mon, 22 Jul 2002 03:05:11 -0500Received: from qaspens_pdc.e-too.com ([208.22.204.130])	by einstein.ssz.com (8.8.8/8.8.8) with ESMTP id DAA32259	for <cypherpunks@ssz.com>: Mon, 22 Jul 2002 03:05:02 -0500From: bcaarj@hotmail.comReceived: from ayg.com (host217-35-123-1.in-addr.btopenworld.com [217.35.123.1]) by qaspens_pdc.e-too.com with SMTP (Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Service Version 5.5.2653.13)	id NX7D9NTS: Mon, 22 Jul 2002 02:03:35 -0500Message-ID: <00007d2926aa$00006ad2$000055ab@byrgestudio.com>To: <rperkins@avana.net>, <farport@earthlink.com>, <airmj@hushmail.com>,   <natn@netzero.net>, <cypherpunks@einstein.ssz.com>Cc: <birdie3380@msn.com>, <rqgu0@yahoo.com>, <rrfjr@msn.com>,   <rudiberg@lineone.net>, <ll@ffni.com>Subject: FW:>Re: Herbal Supplements only $24.99!

What the heck.'Believe me, no matter where you believe those 'feelings'come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would bedoing had I not.

THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET! ==================================================BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you say 'Bull', please read the following.This is the letter you have been hearing about on thenews lately. Due to the popularity of this letter onthe internet, a national weekly news program recentlydevoted an entire show to the investigation of thisprogram described below, to see if it really can makepeople money. The show also investigated whether ornot the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are 'absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can 'follow the simple instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost'. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECTTHIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKINGBETTER THAN EVER. This is what one had to say: 'Thanks to thisprofitable opportunity. I was approached many timesbefore but each time I passed on it. I am so gladI finally joined just to see what one could expectin return for the minimal effort and money required.To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.' Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. ==================================================Another said: 'This program has been around for along time but I never believed in it. But one daywhen I received this again in the mail I decidedto gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simpleinstructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later themoney started to come in.

This is critical to YOUR success. ==================================================**** Take this entire letter, with the modifiedlist of names, and save it on your computer.DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a disk as well just in case you loseany data. To assist you with marketing your businesson the internet, the 5 reports you purchase willprovide you with invaluable marketing informationwhich includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,where to find thousands of free classified ads andmuch more. There are 2 primary methods to get thisventure going: METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ================================================== Let's say that you decide to start small, just to seehow it goes, and we will assume you and those involvedsend out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assumethat the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)response (the response could be much better but let'sjust say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will sendout hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only5,000 each. Continuing with this example, you send out only5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people respondedby sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%responded with orders. That's 100 people whoresponded and ordered Report # 2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each fora total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response tothat is 1000 orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for atotal of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4. Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails eachfor a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders forReport # 5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00(half a million dollars). Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER ANDFIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NOMATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILLMAKE A LOT OF MONEY! ================================================== REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLEORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to thinkfor a moment what would happen if everyone or halfor even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the internetworldwide and counting, with thousands more comingonline every day. Believe me, many people will dojust that, and more! METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ================================================== Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive andthere are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.Placing a lot of free ads on the internet willeasily get a larger response. We strongly suggestyou start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as yougo along. For every $5 you receive, all you mustdo is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.Always provide same day service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,with your name and address on it, will be promptbecause they cannot advertise until they receivethe report. ===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================The reason for the 'cash' is not because this isillegal or somehow 'wrong'. It is simply about time.Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared orapproved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no onecan SEE there is money in the envelope and stealit before it gets to you. ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) foreach report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure thecash is concealed by wrapping it in at least2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets ofpaper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the reportyou are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and yourname and postal address. PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :  ==================================================REPORT # 1: 'The Insider's Guide To Advertisingfor Free On The Net' Order Report #: 1 fromRui Sousa SantosP.O.

I am an accountant with a major U.S.Corporation and I make pretty good money. When Ireceived this program I grumbled to Jody aboutreceiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the wholething, spouting my knowledge of the populationand percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence andfew days later she jumped in with both feet. I mademerciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she hadreceived 50 responses. Within the next 45 days shehad received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.' Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois ================================================'Not being the gambling type, it took me severalweeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.But conservative as I am, I decided that the initialinvestment was so little that there was just no waythat I wouldn't get enough orders to at least getmy money back. I was surprised when I found mymedium size post office box crammed with orders.I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does notmatter where people live. There simply isn't abetter investment with a faster return and so big.' Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada ================================================='I had received this program before. I deleted it,but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.Of course, I had no idea who to contact to getanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailedagain by someone else......... 11 months passed thenit luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all themoney came within 22 weeks.' Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. ================================================='It really is a great opportunity to make relativelyeasy money with little cost to you. I followed thesimple instructions carefully and within 10 days themoney started to come in.

This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.<BR><BR>Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some money with only $25 out of pocket cost''. <BR><BR>DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY &amp: RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED,<SPAN style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp: </SPAN>IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.<BR><BR>This is what one had to say: <BR><BR>'I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it.

To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:<BR><BR>METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY<BR>==========================================================<BR>Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).<BR>Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. <BR><BR>Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.<BR><BR>Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.<SPAN style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp: </SPAN>The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.<BR><BR>Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.<BR><BR>Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report #5 <BR><BR>THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million).<BR>Your total income in this example is: <BR>1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... $5,000 + 4.... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000&nbsp: </P><P class=MsoNormal>Grand Total=$555,550.00<BR><BR>NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL &amp: PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY !<BR><BR>=========================================================<BR><BR>REMEMBER FRIENDS, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO.<SPAN style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp: </SPAN>Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more!<BR><BR>METHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET<BR>=======================================================<BR>Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report.<BR><BR>=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================<BR>ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER &amp: NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper.

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !<BR><BR>============ MORE TESTIMONIALS ================<BR><BR>'My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing,spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her ''hobby''.<SPAN style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp: </SPAN>Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois<BR><BR>======================================================<BR><BR>''Not being the gambling type, it took several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big.'<SPAN style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp: </SPAN>Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada<BR><BR>=======================================================<BR><BR>''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks.'<SPAN style='mso-spacerun: yes'>&nbsp: </SPAN>Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.<BR><BR>=======================================================<BR><BR>''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.

The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of Abacha's enemies.Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State their home state as a kind of house arrest and the eldest son still in detention.Although, a lot of money have been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there's still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safe keeping to the tune of US$50 million.This money US$50 Million is already in North American and if you are interested,we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds,and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the Security Company.Note, there is no risk involved in this project because l am involved as Abacha's confidant.Please you should keep this transaction a top secret and we are prepared to do more business with you pending your approach towards this project.I await your urgent response.Thanks.Yours FaithfullyBARRISTER ADEWALE COKER.--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam---------------------------------------------------------This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeekWelcome to geek heaven.http://thinkgeek.com/sf_______________________________________________Spamassassin-Sightings mailing listSpamassassin-Sightings@lists.sourceforge.nethttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-sightingsReceived: from hq.pro-ns.net (localhost [127.0.0.1])	by hq.pro-ns.net (8.12.5/8.12.5) with ESMTP id g6MA41hY045136	(version=TLSv1/SSLv3 cipher=EDH-DSS-DES-CBC3-SHA bits=168 verify=NO)	for <cypherpunks-forward@ds.pro-ns.net>: Mon, 22 Jul 2002 05:04:02 -0500 (CDT)	(envelope-from cpunks@hq.pro-ns.net)Received: (from cpunks@localhost)	by hq.pro-ns.net (8.12.5/8.12.5/Submit) id g6MA40ZZ045116	for cypherpunks-forward@ds.pro-ns.net: Mon, 22 Jul 2002 05:04:00 -0500 (CDT)Received: from locust.minder.net (locust.minder.net [66.92.53.74])	by hq.pro-ns.net (8.12.5/8.12.5) with ESMTP id g6MA3vhY045079	(version=TLSv1/SSLv3 cipher=EDH-DSS-DES-CBC3-SHA bits=168 verify=NO)	for <cypherpunks@ds.pro-ns.net>: Mon, 22 Jul 2002 05:03:58 -0500 (CDT)	(envelope-from cpunks@waste.minder.net)Received: from waste.minder.net (daemon@waste [66.92.53.73])	by locust.minder.net (8.11.6/8.11.6) with ESMTP id g6MA3uJ26511	for <cypherpunks@ds.pro-ns.net>: Mon, 22 Jul 2002 06:03:56 -0400 (EDT)	(envelope-from cpunks@waste.minder.net)Received: (from cpunks@localhost)	by waste.minder.net (8.11.6/8.11.6) id g6MA3sS11302	for cypherpunks@ds.pro-ns.net: Mon, 22 Jul 2002 06:03:55 -0400Received: from locust.minder.net (locust.minder.net [66.92.53.74])	by waste.minder.net (8.11.6/8.11.6) with ESMTP id g6MA3pR11283	for <cpunks@minder.net>: Mon, 22 Jul 2002 06:03:51 -0400Received: from einstein.ssz.com (cpunks@[207.200.56.4])	by locust.minder.net (8.11.6/8.11.6) with ESMTP id g6MA2UJ26461	for <cpunks@minder.net>: Mon, 22 Jul 2002 06:02:30 -0400 (EDT)	(envelope-from cpunks@einstein.ssz.com)Received: (from cpunks@localhost)	by einstein.ssz.com (8.8.8/8.8.8) id FAA02782	for cpunks@minder.net: Mon, 22 Jul 2002 05:10:32 -0500Received: (from mdom@localhost)	by einstein.ssz.com (8.8.8/8.8.8) id FAA02729	for cypherpunks-outgoing: Mon, 22 Jul 2002 05:08:32 -0500Received: from dnvrpop9.dnvr.uswest.net (dnvrpop9.dnvr.uswest.net [206.196.128.11])	by einstein.ssz.com (8.8.8/8.8.8) with SMTP id FAA02701	for <cypherpunks@ssz.com>: Mon, 22 Jul 2002 05:07:03 -0500Received: (qmail 94130 invoked by uid 0): 22 Jul 2002 09:58:32 -0000Received: from ddslppp221.dnvr.uswest.net (HELO tadserv.traveladvocateinc.com) (216.160.163.221)  by dnvrpop9.dnvr.uswest.net with SMTP: 22 Jul 2002 09:58:32 -0000Received: from mx06.hotmail.com (ACBE97CA.ipt.aol.com [172.190.151.202]) by tadserv.traveladvocateinc.com with SMTP (Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Service Version 5.5.2653.13)	id PDHY2PW8: Mon, 22 Jul 2002 03:55:59 -0600Date: Mon, 22 Jul 2002 02:59:55 -1900Message-ID: <0000373c47ac$00007c7b$0000347c@mx06.hotmail.com>From: 'Brianna' <ie9mugg9p0681@hotmail.com>To: barklage@earthlink.comCc: roerig@worldnet.att.net, fdr@fdrholidays.com, jfwee@aol.com,   liz@lizlawrence.com, wade@dundee.net, stevem@janessa.com,   cypherpunks@einstein.ssz.com, ddike@digitalskylight.comOld-Subject: CDR: Herbal Viagra 30 day trial....

I also started the Anti-Aging formula, GH1. <BR>After a year on the product, my blood pressure is now 120/80-- <BR>and I haven't been on the blood pressure medication for months!' <BR>-Susanne Peters, Laguna Beach, CA <BR><BR>'After 2 weeks on Anti-Aging Formula GH1, I noticed a higher <BR>level of energy, increased sexual energy and my memory and vision <BR>were enhanced. My blood pressure is down to 126/84 after workout-and <BR>it seems every other day I have to 'rev-up' the amps on the treadmill <BR>at the gym. I've noticed a tightening of the skin under my chin and <BR>a change in my lungs with much easier breathing. After 4 months, <BR>I only need 5 hours sleep instead of 7. One morning, I had to do an extra <BR>karate workout just to expend all the extra energy!' 'After 6 months on <BR>GH1, my blood sugar levels went from 130 down to 65! Also, my stamina has <BR>increased, as well as my energy and sex drive--this product is GREAT!' <BR>-Dr. Richard Boyd, 78 years old, Harvard Clinical Psychologist, CA <BR><BR>'As a straight-ahead bicycle racer, I used to have to wait a minute <BR>and a half after sprinting, for my heart rate to come down to where <BR>I could sprint again. After a month on GH1, I can now sprint again <BR>after only 45 seconds! GH1 cut my waiting time in half!' <BR>-Ed Caz, age 40, Fresno,CA <BR><BR>'When I heard GH1 would reduce body fat increase lean muscle WITHOUT EXERCISE, I couldn't believe it--but in just a few months I lost 4 inches around my waist without exercising and my body fat went from 22 down to 19--even though I gained 10 pounds! Also, after 4 months, my fine vision returned. I no longer need the magnifying glasses to read fine print.' <BR>-Larry Baker, age 54,Oceanside, CA <BR><BR>'I have been taking Anti-Aging Formula GH1 for five months now. <BR>I have been under great stress in my business. <BR>I believe that taking Anti-Aging Formula GH1 has had a big part in keeping <BR>my energy level up and having the strength to stay positive in the midst <BR>of discouraging circumstances. Last week I came down with a cold. <BR>Colds are tough on me and seem to run their course- headaches, sinus inflammation, and then throat. I am progressing through those stages but more quickly than before. Hallelujah! My eyes aren't as puffy and the skin on my hands snaps back faster. <BR>My muscles seem to have better tone-I notice it in my legs-and I have more energy <BR>when I go out walking.' <BR>- Carolyn Munn <BR><BR>'I was taking injections of GH for over one year. A friend suggested that <BR>I try Anti-Aging Formula GH1, since I was spending 1,000 US dollars a month and needed <BR>a doctor to inject it daily. In 2-3 weeks I felt better from the Anti-Aging <BR>Formula GH1 than the whole time I was getting the injections. <BR>Thank you Anti-Aging Formula for greatly helping to improve my life!' <BR>-Rita Mills McCoy <BR><BR>'I have had elevated cholesterol levels since the first time I was tested, <BR>in my twenties. I was on Anti-Aging Formula GHI for only 1 month when my levels <BR>dropped from 245 to 210. I could hardly believe it! After 3 months on Anti-Aging <BR>Formula GH1 my gray hair began to darken at the roots, returning to its normal <BR>coloring. I have even been able to reduce my thyroid medication. All of this <BR>without having to change anything else about my lifestyle, other than taking <BR>few sprays of Anti-Aging Formula GH1 a day. Wow! <BR>-Alan Ross, 43 years old <BR><BR>GH1 is the highest concentration of orally administered GH1 <BR>available on the market today. Injections of GH taken in international units are usually prescribed to be taken as a shot, two times per day. The individual would be taking between 2 and 4 units per day. GH1 has over 2000ng per dosage and was created to imitate the body's natural secretion of GH. <BR></B></FONT><FONT color='#FF0000'><B> <BR></B></FONT><FONT size=3><FONT color='#FF0000'><B> WHAT IS GROWTH HORMONE (GH)?</B></FONT><FONT size=3><FONT color='#FF0000'><B>  <BR><BR>Growth hormone is a naturally occurring substance in the human body which <BR>is secreted by the pituitary, the master gland of the body, located in the <BR>endocrine system. GH is a microscopic protein substance that is chemically <BR>similar to insulin, which is secreted in short pulses during the first few <BR>hours of sleep and after exercise. GH is one of the most abundant hormones <BR>secreted, influencing growth of cells, bones, muscles and organs throughout <BR>the body. Production of GH peaks at adolescence. <BR><BR>Every three years approximately 90% of the cells in the human body are newly made. <BR>The body is composed of more than 100 trillion cells that are continuously <BR>dying and regenerating. The brain and the nervous system retain their original <BR>cells: however, in the brain new proteins are continuously being produced to <BR>store memories of every new experience. Overall intelligence and the ability <BR>to learn and memorize all depend on adequate growth hormone. <BR><BR>Growth hormone replacement therapy is now available to reverse age-related symptoms, including wrinkling of the skin, increased body fat, decreased muscle mass, increased cholesterol, decreased stamina and energy, decreased mental function and loss of libido. <BR>When growth hormone falls below normal levels, supplementation offers the <BR>all-natural potential for great benefit. Growth hormone is an amazing substance <BR>which is safe and effective with no known side effects, if taken in the <BR>proper dosage amounts. <BR><BR>GH is one of many endocrine hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, <BR>melatonin and DHEA, that all decline in production as we age. Hormones are tiny <BR>chemical messengers continuously secreted in the bloodstream in order to regulate <BR>the activities of the vital organs. The word 'hormone' is derived from a Greek word <BR>meaning to stimulate. Many of these hormones can be replaced to deter some of the <BR>effects of aging: however, GH reaches far beyond the scope of these other <BR>hormones. Not only does it prevent biological aging, but it acts to greatly <BR>reverse a broad range of signs and symptoms associated with aging, including <BR>making the skin more elastic and causing wrinkles to disappear. GH also <BR>helps restore hair color and hair loss. <BR></B></FONT><FONT size=3><FONT color='#FF0000'><B> <BR>THE ETERNAL FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH?</B></FONT><FONT size=3><FONT color='#FF0000'><B>  <BR><BR>Our bodies naturally produce GH in abundance when we are young, and its production <BR>gradually slows over time. The amount of GH after the age of 21 falls about 14% per <BR>decade, so that its production is reduced in half by age 60. While GH is not new, <BR>its availability as a supplement has been limited. Specialized clinics and physicians <BR>have been using GH for over 30 years on thousands of patients with consistent results. <BR>Unfortunately, due to the high costs previously associated with GH, only the medical <BR>profession and the wealthy have been privy to its benefits. Another problem has been <BR>that the large GH molecule, composed of 191 amino acids (protein), had been only <BR>effective administered through injections. However, a new technology developed by <BR>Anti-Aging Inc., now makes GH an effective, affordable and convenient alternative. <BR></B></FONT><FONT size=3><FONT color='#FF0000'><B> <BR>GH production falls by 80% from age 21 to 61</B></FONT><FONT size=3><FONT color='#FF0000'><B>  <BR></B></FONT><FONT face='MS Sans Serif'><FONT size=3><FONT color='#FF0000'><B> <BR>Growth hormone declines with age in every animal species that has been tested to date. <BR>The amount of decline in humans falls approximately 14% per decade. <BR>This results in the growth hormone production rate being reduced in half by the age <BR>of 60. Humans produce on a daily basis 500 micrograms per year at age 20, <BR>200 micrograms at age 40 and 25 micrograms at 80 years of age. Between the ages <BR>of 70 and 80, nearly everyone is deficient in growth hormone which results in SDS, <BR>or Somatotrophin Deficiency Syndrome. These symptoms are part of the disease called <BR>aging which the medical community has determined is not a normal occurrence. <BR>Healing ability and energy levels decrease, as does physical mobility. <BR>Those who want to maintain their youthful vitality and stamina should include <BR>an effective growth hormone therapy as part of their health regimen.</B></FONT><FONT face='Times New Roman'><FONT size=3><FONT color='#FF0000'><B>  <BR><BR>After numerous clinical studies, the following was determined <BR>after 6 or more months of GH therapy: <BR></B></FONT><FONT color='#FFFF00'><B> _ Improved memory <BR>_ Regenerating of the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys and other organs <BR>_ Increased sexual drive and performance <BR>_ Increased fertility <BR>_ Enhanced immune system <BR>_ Quicker wound and fracture healing <BR>_ New hair growth and color reparation <BR>_ Sharper vision <BR>_ Improved exercise performance and tolerance <BR>_ Increased muscle mass without exercise <BR>_ Reduction of cellulite and fat <BR>_ Increased stamina and vitality <BR>_ Reduction in high blood pressure <BR>_ Improvement in sleep <BR>_ Anti-aging <BR>_ Wrinkle reduction and smoothing <BR>_ Decrease in LDL (bad) cholesterol <BR>_ Increase in HDL (good) cholesterol <BR>_ Strengthening of bones <BR></B></FONT><FONT size=3><FONT color='#FFFF00'><B> <BR></B></FONT><FONT color='#FF0000'><B> IS GH SAFE?</B></FONT><FONT size=3><FONT color='#FF0000'><B>  </B></FONT><FONT color='#00FF00'><B> <BR>GH has been successfully used in the medical community <BR>for over thirty years and has been studies for over 60 years. <BR>Edmond Klein, M.D. and L.

There are 2 Primarymethods to get thisventure going: METHOD # 1: BYSENDING BULK E-MAILLEGALLY============================================Let's say that you decide to start small, justto see how it goes,and we will assume You and thoseinvolved send out only5,000 e-mails each.  Let's also assume thatthe mailing receiveonly a 0.2% response (the response couldbe much better butlets just say it is only 0.2%. Also manypeople will send outhundreds of thousands e-mails instead ofonly 5,000 each).Continuing with this example, you send outonly 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only10 orders for report #1. Those 10 people responded by sendingout 5,000 e-maileach for a total of 50,000. Out of those50,000 e-mails only0.2% responded with orders.That's=100 people responded and orderedReport # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mailseach for a total of500,000 e-mails.  The 0.2% response tothat is 1000 orders forReport # 3.Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mailseach for a total of 5million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% responseto that is 10,000orders for report #4.  Those 10,000 peoplesend out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50million) e-mails. The0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders forReport  # 5.THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5EACH=$500,000.00(half million).Your total income in this example is: 1.....$50 + 2..... $500 +3.....$5,000 + 4 . $50,000 + 5..... $500,000.......

FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION,BUSINESS PROPOSAL: TRANSFER OF US$ 22.5 M (TWENTY TWOMILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS)& BUSINESS INVESTMENTS PARTNERSHIP.First, I must solicit your strictest confidence inthis transaction, this is by  virtue of it's nature asbeing utterly confidential and top secret as you wereintroduced to us in confidence through the NigerianChamber of Commerce, foreign trade division. I am the chairman of the Economic Recovery Committe(ERC) set up by the present civilian Government ofNigeria to review contracts awarded  by the pastmilitary administration.In the course of our work at the ERC, we discoveredthis fund which resulted from gross re-valuation ofcontracts  by top government officials of  the lastadministration. The companies that executed thecontracts have been duly paid and the contractscommissioned leaving the sum of US$22.5 Millionfloating in the escrow account of the Central Bank ofNigeria  ready for payment.I have therefore been mandated as a matter of trust bymy colleagues in the committee to look for an overseaspartner to whom we could transfer the sum of US$22.5Mlegally subcontracting the entitlement to you/yourcompany. This is bearing in mind that our  civilservice code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign company or running  foreign account while ingovernment service hence the need for an overseaspartner.We have agreed that the funds will be shared thusafter it has been paid into your account:(1) 25% of the money will go to you for acting as thebeneficiary of the fund.(2) 5% has been set aside as an abstract projectionfor reimbursment to both parties for incidentalexpences that may be incurred in the course of thetransaction.(3) 70% to us the government officials (with  which wewish to commence an importation business inconjunction with you ).

When working in Windoze I've always taken the approach of rebooting on a regular basis before I've had problems, </snip>I believe AOL is a shell that sits on Windows, which pretty much negates any hope for stability. *nix is the only non-Mac answer for reliable computing. I am a Red Hat Linux user as everyone's favourite Redmond OS obviously requires more smarts than I have to make it do anything useful. If you have to live with it however there is a cool little FREE download called FreeMem which you can get here:http://www.meikel.comThis utility frees up memory at a click when you exit an app, you also get to see how your memory gets eaten up and not released. This may not fix your problem but at least Windows will be running at peak performance all the time and much easier than constant rebooting. The more you use this OS the more of these little third party fixer upper proggys and utilities you have to search for.HTH.

It's very flashy and maybejust a tad overdone. I had difficulty finding my way aroundyour site and couldn't understand its purpose until I had gonethree pages into it. Maybe it would be a little more useful tomake your front page navigation a little less confusing?The 'next page' tab is right next to one that says 'bookmarkthis page' - no information until you mouseover the tab totell you you are entering the site. I felt a little overwhelmedwith glitz - animated gif's overemphasized words etc and notenough information on your openning page.~~~~I also surprised to see a site for Florida rentals with a URLending with .uk.  Recommendations for this site.1. On the home page a person's eyes are drawn first to theanimation and red text on the yellow background, missingthe first sentence. Remove the animation and add moredetails to this important introduction. Instead of using the'click here' button, just have a text link following directlyafter the introduction.2. On the second page, have all your links the same color,and all your text a different color. Don't confuse people onwhat is a link and what they need to read. Underlined texton the internet can often be confused for a link, expeciallywhen it is in the normal blue link color.  Having theimportant links in red and with the flashing arrow is overkill.3. On the rest of the site, you have good information, butyou don't need the top menu bar when using the framedmenu and the pages are all untitled.I hope you don't think I'm being too harsh, I just know youwant the best site you can have and I think these changeswill make a world of difference.  Once a person gets into thesite you have the information organized and complete. Ieven wanted to come and stay!~~~~The animations make this site look amateurish from thebeginning.  The flashing 'Bookmark This Site' makes mewant to leave instead of come back!  The font Comic SansMS also looks very kiddy.  Much could be done to improvethis site.~~~~I was confused by this site. There are four animated gifs on thefirst screen, and so my eyes kept flicking back and forth betweenthem. I read over the paragraph of information, but didn't knowwhere to click. I finally figured out the 'click here' button shouldhave been up by the text and that is where I should go.On the 2nd page, again too many flashing gifs.  Other than that,the 2nd page was much easier to find my way around. Onesuggestion, if you're using frames it is unneccessary to havethe menu of links listed both on one frame and at the top ofthe page as was shown on the 'special offers' page.The font style and bright colors made the site look casual andlaid back, like a trip to Florida should be, so that was good.Besides the flashing gifs, by the time I left I liked this site, butif I hadn't been reviewing it I don't know if I would have gottenthat far.~~~~This site is bright and breezy. It is very clean, easy to readand navigate. Logically presented and information-rich.Some pages had too many animated images for my own taste,but the pages are happy and cheery. Tip: If you can get a holdof PaintShop Pro, you can take out the white squares thatform a background for some images.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~______________________________________________________moderator: Amy Mossel:  Moderator@AEOpublishing.composting:  MyInput@AEOpublishing.com______________________________________________________Send posts and questions (or your answers) to:   mailto:MyInput@AEOpublishing.comPlease send suggestions and comments to:   mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.comTo change your subscribed address, send both newand old address to mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.comSee below for unsubscribe instructions.Copyright 2001 AEOpublishing----- End of Your Membership Exchange------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This email has been sent to jm@netnoteinc.com at your request, by Your Membership Newsletter Services.Visit our Subscription Center to edit your interests or unsubscribe.http://ccprod.roving.com/roving/d.jsp?p=oo&id=bd7n7877.jbozuta6&m=bd7n7877&ea=jm@netnoteinc.comView our privacy policy: http://ccprod.roving.com/roving/CCPrivacyPolicy.jspPowered by Constant Contact(R)www.constantcontact.com"

TiVo: Now or Never?"|"TVPredictions.com Newsletter (August 7, 2002)The #1 Newsletter on the Future of TVHi Everyone,First of all, I want to welcome those<br>subscribers who are getting this newsletter<br>for the first time. Here you will find <br>hard-hitting commentary and analysis<br>on issues related to the future of television.<br>Whether it's Interactive TV, the battle between<br>the cable news networks, the latest in <br>the Emmy race, or the federal government's<br>fight to promote HDTV, TV Predictions will <br>give you the scoop -- before it actually <br>occurs. And, as long-time subscribers<br>will tell you, we pull no punches. <br><br>(FYI -- TVPredictions.com, based in Los <br>Angeles, is owned and managed by Phillip Swann,<br>author of 'TV dot Com: The Future of <br>Interactive Television.' He has been <br>quoted as an expert on TV issues in publications<br>such as The Hollywood Reporter, Variety and <br>Electronic Media.) <br><br>Now, in this issue, we offer an all-new edition of...<br>the Interactive TV Power Rankings!

The company's stock<br>dipped below three this week. And network execs<br>are openly questioning whether the digital recorder,<br>which permits skipping commercials with a few <br>clicks of the remote, will destroy their advertising<br>models. There even have been hints that the <br>networks could support a move by the cable <br>industry to offer a PVR that does not permit<br>commercial skipping. And that PVR would not <br>be a TiVo. <br><br>To its credit, TiVo has been remarkably successful <br>at building brand loyalty and awareness. TiVo <br>reports that 97 percent of its subscribers have<br>recommended the service to a friend. And when<br>people talk about PVRs, they say TiVo. (Just <br>like the way people say 'Coke' when they talk<br>about soft drinks. )<br><br>But Wall Street, the media and the industry <br>are all growing impatient. TiVo needs to start<br>putting some big numbers on the board -- <br>and it needs to do it this holiday season. If <br>it doesn't, stock analysts who have supported TiVo <br>until now will run for the hills. That will push<br>the company's stock price down even further. And<br>if that happens, TiVo could have just two choices:<br>Sell the company under duress or wait until its <br>funding dries up. <br><br>Consequently, I predict that TiVo will launch <br>an intensive marketing blitz over the next <br>five months, right through the holiday season.<br>The blitz will include a sharp increase in <br>retail distribution, TV advertising and PR <br>efforts. The company needs to show Wall <br>Street -- and the industry -- that it will be <br>the brand leader in the PVR category. And it<br>needs to show that it can generate<br>mass consumer demand. <br><br>How does TiVo demonstrate that?<br><br>Anything short of 750,000 subs at year's end<br>will have people questioning whether TiVo has<br>the right stuff. Cable execs, who are watching<br>TiVo closely, might decide that adding the <br>service is not such a great selling point <br>after all. And Echostar, which currently does<br>not have an agreement with TiVo, may decide<br>to stay with its unbranded PVR service after <br>its merger with DIRECTV is approved in D.C. <br>(TiVo currently has a partnership with DIRECTV,<br>but it's unclear what will happen to the deal if <br>the merger is approved.) <br><br>So there is much at stake -- and it's not extreme<br>to say that TiVo's ultimate future could be decided<br>in the next several months. <br><br>Will it succeed? I predict that TiVo will achieve<br>a partial success. The company will boost its <br>subscriber numbers and it will maintain its claim<br>as the #1 PVR service. However, in time, I <br>also predict it will decide to sell the company<br>to a large media outfit, such as Sony or perhaps<br>even Liberty Media. This would give TiVo the <br>necessary funding and industry connections<br>for long-term growth and survival.<br><br>To see more predictions on the future of TV, <br>click below! <br>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Breaking News=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=tpysjsn6.e9iqjsn6.rqhvuqn6&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tvpredictions.comDid you know that...<br><br>* Cox Cable has decided to slow down its <br>roll-out of Video on Demand?<br><br>* Consumers have no idea what HDTV is <br>all about, according to a new study?<br><br>* One top network exec says viewers may <br>soon have to pay for off-air, free TV? <br><br>* According to the Associated Press, <br>the cable news networks may be spreading fear<br>in our culture?<br><br>* Las Vegas says West Wing's Martin Sheen<br>is a shoo-in for a Best Actor Emmy? <br><br>These are just some of the many stories now <br>available for reading at TVPredictions.com <br>You can also read our prediction on CNN and<br>Larry King, our expose of Forrester Research<br>and Josh Bernoff, and perhaps our most <br>provocative story, 'Sex and the Interactive <br>TV.' <br><br>Click below to get the latest on the future of <br>TV! <br>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Coming Attractions!=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=tpysjsn6.e9iqjsn6.rqhvuqn6&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tvpredictions.comThe TVPredictions.com newsletter is published<br>every Friday.

My >defragmentor  keeps starting over and over and my scan >disk never finds anything wrong, but there has to be. Dear Nicety,As regards your problem with Windoze freezing and locking up your computer I'm afraid your 'SOL' as finding a true solution.  There are many factors in the operating system that cause conflicts resulting in a locked machine.  One major problem is that many programs don't release memory when you exit.  When working in Windoze I've always taken the approach of rebooting on a regular basis before I've had problems, especially if I've opened and closed several different applications.Back in August 1999 John Kirch, a Microsoft Certified Professional,wrote an extensive article discussing the merits of a *nix operatingsystem vs Windows NT.  You can read it at http://www.unix-vs-nt.org/kirch/.  What was true back then is even truer today.  Every current 'worm' you are hearing about on the news lately occurs in Windoze operating systems.  So, IMHO, the solution to your machine locking-up is to change the OS.  Running Linux, my machine has been up for periods of weeks at a time with no need to reboot.  In over a year of running I can count the lock-ups on one hand and have fingers left over. I have more software installed than I ever had in Windoze ... and the price is right -- free.Jim Shofstallwebmaster@wonderpaint.comhttp://www.wonderpaint.com______________________________________________________>>>>>> WEBSITE SHOWCASES <<<<<<Examine carefully - those with email addresses included WILLtrade links with you, you are encouraged to contact them.

They are both very attractive and well presented.  In my opinion, the book site could have been a little softer, or with similar characteristics to the next site, preparing me for the site that it links to, and having a relationship to it.What I did feel most, was that I was expecting something related to the url  'prosperouswomen' to come up, as this 'word' was what caught my attention and caused me to click in the first place.I feel the book page should be a tool for the 'PW' page and not a preface to it.  The main site should be the PW and the book site could be a link or a popup or an additional page.(You need to take e out of changing on the book page.)With these:Find out how you can receive the free book.Email us at directions4U@aol.com        andFor this and a number of other free books on networkmarketing write to us at directions4U@aol.comI would have liked these to be clickable links, rather than copy and paste.Very nice job on the sites, Margarete ... I really liked them. (and I have ordered the book!)~~~~I waited over 70 seconds and had yet to see the first page.  Could not determine if this was related to volume of graphics or where we were headed.~~~~Very clear, focused site with one page promoting a free book.Don't underline text unless it's a link, or somehow distinguish between the links and that which is not.I finally figured out the logo for properouswomen was also linked so I checked that out also. I think you need to make that link more noticeable, and also link to your bizland site.If you used a form for ordering the book instead of sending a request message to an aol email address you would get more requests, and also might be able to automate this process.~~~~I loved this site because it was clear, simple and to the point.It also peaked my curiosity and I followed the link supplied.  If only other sites we so simplistic!~~~~With the masterminding site, the first sentence 'Major Impact on Your Life' is incomplete. There were also run-on sentences in the copy, even though the copy is quite effective. The box with 'Life Changeing Insight' needs the 'e' taken out of 'changeing', and it looked like the text could have been extended to go from side to side. In the first paragraph  '... an amazing 100 year old text...' felt like it should be 'book' or 'secret' instead of using the word 'text'.  Also it would add credibility to say where or how or by whom it was discovered.The message is clear, the site design simple. Two things that would make the site more effective (on getting people to request the book) would be to say if this is an ebook, how long it is, in what format it is, etc. and then also using a form for people to order instead of emailing. You should be able to pick up a form for this just about anywhere.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~______________________________________________________moderator: Amy Mossel:  Moderator@AEOpublishing.composting:  MyInput@AEOpublishing.com______________________________________________________Send posts and questions (or your answers) to:   mailto:MyInput@AEOpublishing.comPlease send suggestions and comments to:   mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.comTo change your subscribed address, send both newand old address to mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.comSee below for unsubscribe instructions.Copyright 2001 AEOpublishing----- End of Your Membership Exchange------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This email has been sent to jm@netnoteinc.com at your request, by Your Membership Newsletter Services.Visit our Subscription Center to edit your interests or unsubscribe.http://ccprod.roving.com/roving/d.jsp?p=oo&id=bd7n7877.6vihnja6&m=bd7n7877&ea=jm@netnoteinc.comView our privacy policy: http://ccprod.roving.com/roving/CCPrivacyPolicy.jspPowered by Constant Contact(R)www.constantcontact.com"

This is often because webmasters do not have theability or time to design and create unique websites. Thesefive points will help you come up with a one-of-a-kind designfor your website.1. Navigation SystemDeciding on a navigation system should be one of the firstthings to consider when designing your website. Visitorsusually look for a way to get to the information they wantbefore reading anything else. I would suggest putting yournavigation system in two areas. Look at WebmasterBase (http://www.webmasterbase.com) for example. There is a list of categories on the left, and information about the network on the top bar.It is not recommended that you place your navigation at thebottom of the page because:- People see the top of the page first- If you have a lot of content on one page, the navigation gets   pushed to bottom of the page... away from the visitor.2. Color SchemeWhen you are choosing colors, make sure they contrast. Forexample, do not use bright green and florescent pink. Somecolors that are often used are white on black or black onwhite.A wonderful utility that is web-based and free is Color Schemer(http://www.godigitalstudios.com/www/color/), created by AaronEpstein. Many other programs exist that can assist you inchoosing colors. Try doing a search on FreewareFiles (http://www.freewarefiles.com), Tucows (http://www.tucows.com),or Download.com (http://www.download.com) for 'color schemer.'3. Content WindowThis is the brain of the website. Make sure that the text hereis easy to read and understand.Also, provide your own original content. People do not want tohear what somebody else has to say. They want to hear what you want to say! While it might be time consuming to writeyour own content, it sure is worth it.To find content for your website, try searching atEzineArticles (http://www.ezinearticles.com). Other people mayhave used the articles, but if you become good friends with theauthors, they may send you new content as they write it. Becareful though. Do not use too much content from other authors, as mentioned above.4. Font(s)Several types of fonts exist. The first one I will discuss isfixed width or monospace, similar to Courier or Courier New.Fixed width fonts are good for displaying code (like HTML.)Another type of font is called sans serif. It is similar toArial (Windows) or Helvetica (Macintosh). This font can be used for long pieces of text.The final type of font is called serif because it has serifs,or curves, in each letter. Often, this font is called Times(Windows) or Georgia (Macintosh). This font, like sans serif,is often used for long blocks of text. It is preferred becauseits rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter, making iteasier to read.5. AdvertisingAh, everybody's favorite... advertising! This is one of thing that almost every website has. The most common type is what is known as 'banner' advertising. It is called that because it is long and thin (like a paper banner.) How long you ask? The generic kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high.New sizes however are being used. Take for example the newstyle called 'skyscraper' -- so called for a reason: it lookslike a skyscraper. It is tall (about 425 pixels) but not toowide (about 100-125 pixels.)Finding a way to place advertising can be tricky. Banners used to be placed (and still are) only at the top of the page.Nevertheless, banners are starting to be placed in the middleof the page, at the bottom, or along the side.    ConclusionThese are only five things to consider when designing awebsite. There are many others however. Let me know what you find that helps you create a unique website.

This is often because webmasters do not<br>have the ability or time to design and create unique websites.<br>These five points will help you come up with a one-of-a-kind<br>design for your website.<p>1. Navigation System<p>Deciding on a navigation system should be one of the first<br>things to consider when designing your website. Visitors<br>usually look for a way to get to the information they want<br>before reading anything else. I would suggest putting your<br>navigation system in two areas. Look at WebmasterBase<br>(<a href='http://www.webmasterbase.com'>http://www.webmasterbase.com</a>)for example. There is a list<br>of categories on the left, and information about the network<br>on the top bar.<p>It is not recommended that you place your navigation at the<br>bottom of the page because:<p>- People see the top of the page first<br>- If you have a lot of content on one page, the navigation<br>&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp: gets pushed to bottom of the page... away from thevisitor.<p>2. Color Scheme<p>When you are choosing colors, make sure they contrast.<br>For example, do not use bright green and florescent pink.<br>Some colors that are often used are white on black or black<br>on white.<p>A wonderful utility that is web-based and free is Color<br>Schemer (<a href='http://www.godigitalstudios.com/www/color/'>http://www.godigitalstudios.com/www/color/</a>),<br>created by Aaron Epstein. Many other programs exist that<br>can assist you in choosing colors. Try doing a search on<br>FreewareFiles (<a href='http://www.freewarefiles.com'>http://www.freewarefiles.com</a>),Tucows<br>(<a href='http://www.tucows.com'>http://www.tucows.com</a>), or Download.com<br>(<a href='http://www.download.com'>http://www.download.com</a>) for'color schemer.'<p>3. Content Window<p>This is the brain of the website. Make sure that the text<br>here is easy to read and understand.<p>Also, provide your own original content. People do not want<br>to hear what somebody else has to say. They want to hear<br>what <i>you</i> want to say! While it might be time consuming to<br>write your own content, it sure is worth it.<p>To find content for your website, try searching at<br>EzineArticles (<a href='http://www.ezinearticles.com'>http://www.ezinearticles.com</a>).Other people<br>may have used the articles, but if you become good friends<br>with the authors, they may send you new content as they<br>write it. Be careful though. Do not use too much content<br>from other authors, as mentioned above.<p>4. Font(s)<p>Several types of fonts exist. The first one I will discuss is<br>fixed width or monospace, similar to Courier or Courier New.<br>Fixed width fonts are good for displaying code (like HTML.)<p>Another type of font is called sans serif. It is similar to<br>Arial (Windows) or Helvetica (Macintosh). This font can<br>be used for long pieces of text.<p>The final type of font is called serif because it has serifs,<br>or curves, in each letter. Often, this font is called Times<br>(Windows) or Georgia (Macintosh). This font, like sans serif,<br>is often used for long blocks of text. It is preferred because<br>its rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter, making<br>it easier to read.<p>5. Advertising<p>Ah, everybody's favorite... advertising! This is one of thing<br>that almost every website has. The most common type is<br>what is known as 'banner' advertising. It is called that<br>because it is long and thin (like a paper banner.) How long<br>you ask? The generic kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high.<p>New sizes however are being used. Take for example the<br>new style called 'skyscraper' -- so called for a reason: it<br>looks like a skyscraper. It is tall (about 425 pixels) but not<br>too wide (about 100-125 pixels.)<p>Finding a way to place advertising can be tricky. Banners<br>used to be placed (and still are) only at the top of the<br>page.&nbsp: Nevertheless, banners are starting to be placed in<br>the middle of the page, at the bottom, or along the side.<p>Conclusion<p>These are only five things to consider when designing a<br>website. There are many others however. Let me know<br>what you find that helps you create a unique website.

I hear about so many people being super scared to give out their SS#.  Well folks, I can get your SS# for 50 cents.  Give me a name and address and about 90% of the time I can get the number.  We are so worried about putting our credit card number onthe net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.  They could do who knows what with the CC number.  I once had a person tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that person (me) would have her account info and could write a check out for thousands of dollars.  I told her to just send it to me then and she said that was OK.  Then I asked her to tell me what the difference was between the original check and a fax copy.  I told her to ask her lawyer that too.  Never heard back from her.  The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is available in many places.  Have a good day.--  Terry    http://mysiteinc.com/tfn/lfi.html~~~~~~~~~Yes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However, we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most importantly, never give any personal information at a site that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar or a Veri secure sign or others. Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put in my credit information in each time instead of having an account in standing, a little more time but less risks involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!--  Catherine F.      http://www.catco.nexgenmall.com ~~~~~~~~~Yes. I had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that my ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner was in a bad car accident.  I had a full service account.  My Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address went unprotected.  A Russian stepped in: paid the fees: and, promptly assigned my www.SchoolOfGeomatics.com address to a porn shop.  Thus, I lost 4 years of building up 1st place rankings on 12 Search Engines and 2nd place on 8 more.  This set me back about 4  months: I believe I lost a minimum of $50,000.   I have also been hit with viruses about 10 times.  The first time I lost almost 4 months of work.  Now, I back up often enough to not to lose so much time.  This is also Internet theft.  These people are nothing but out and out criminals and should spend years behind bars. Customers are well protected from credit card theft: however, merchants can lose a lot of money.  I sell only by purchase order and certified or registered company checks.--  Peter S.    http://www.GSSGeomatics.com~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~               JULY WINNER ANNOUNCED!And the July 'One-Question Survey' WINNER is...

What you do to  <BR>become successful in the online world is not a 'secret',  <BR>in my opinion. Most successful people follow simple, clear,  <BR>repeatedly-proven strategies to succeed, whether on the  <BR>Net or off. <BR> <BR>But, when it comes to someone asking for advice,  <BR>consultation, or simply asking, 'What's your secret?',  <BR>I have to blush & say ... <BR> <BR>Persistence and personality. <BR> <BR>Of course, I always follow the advice with my own little  <BR>disclaimer: What makes ME successful may not work the  <BR>same for YOU ... & your first lesson is to get over  <BR>the deep-seeded idea that success - of any kind, in   <BR>my opinion - is somehow an unknown, unattainable secret. <BR> <BR>Clearly, it is not. It's not unknown. It's not unattainable.  <BR>It's not years of digging to find the 'secrets' to internet riches. <BR> <BR>One thing that 'gets to me' so often in my work as an  <BR>Internet Consultant, author and Internet Success  <BR>Strategist is that so many people on the Net seem to  <BR>have this incredibly huge mental block that stands  <BR>between themselves and success on the Net. It's  <BR>almost as if they've been barraged by so many claims  <BR>of what works and what doesn't work, and so many  <BR>LONG, complicated routes to actually succeeding in  <BR>their online venture, that 'success' is the  <BR>equivelant of a 100-foot high brick wall. <BR> <BR>It's NOT that difficult, my friends! It is NOT that complicated!! <BR> <BR>Long-time friend and business associate Rick Beneteau  <BR>has a new eBook out called Branding YOU & Breaking <BR>the Bank. Get it!!  <BR><a href='http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb'>http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb</a> .  <BR>But, the reason I mention this is the fact that he talks  <BR>so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your  <BR>online venture a success.  <BR> <BR>And, yes, Rick & I come from the same school of  <BR>'self marketing' - marketing YOU! Obviously, that's  <BR>the core of his excellent new ebook, and I couldn't  <BR>agree with him more. <BR> <BR>Point being, *you* ARE everything you do online to  <BR>succeed. You ARE your web site, your business, your  <BR>marketing piece, your customer service, your customers'  <BR>experiences with your business -- ALL of it, is YOU!  <BR>Read his ebook & you'll see more of what I'm saying. <BR> <BR>The matter at hand is that brick wall you might have  <BR>standing high as you can see, blocking the path  <BR>between you & internet success. Listen to me - it is  <BR>not real OK? It doesn't exist. There's nothing there  <BR>to fear to begin with ... get over it!! <BR> <BR>What I'm telling you is, the only thing standing between  <BR>you and the success you most desire ... is yourself.  <BR>When you realize this, you will tear down that brick  <BR>wall by means of complete and instantaneous  <BR>disintegration. It will no longer exist *in your mind*,  <BR>which is the only 'real' place it ever was anyhow! <BR> <BR>Yes, 'persistence and personality' inherently includes  <BR>honesty, integrity, accountability, and many other  <BR>qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate  <BR>goals and realize that probably the most valuable,   <BR>powerful key to your success ... is YOU! <BR> <BR>That may be the most incredible 'secret' we ever  <BR>uncover in our lifetime! And, trust me, that brick wall  <BR>won't ever get in your way again ... unless you let it. <BR> <BR>Talk about SIMPLE!! <BR> <BR>------------------------------------------------------ <BR>Bryan is a 'veteran'  Internet  Consultant, Author,  <BR>Internet Success Strategist & Marketer.

We offer a service and at this time take deposits and payments via our site.Our site has been up less than 2 months and our expectation was that we would refer to our site for leads developed in traditional media and by referral for more information, and to make a professional impression on someone you may not meet before providing service.The growth of our customer base shopping on line has grown outside of anyone's expectations.......certainly mine and I've been in this business for 25 years. The Internet is not dead in the horse business, it is just getting it's legs, and the folks using it want to get all the ancillary services on-line as well.

While quality customer service and product have been and will always be our top priority brand building Zesto is our most challenging task.<BR>Zesto.com ranks very high and most often #1 or 2 on all major search engines and directories even Yahoo entering the keyword zesto. The problem is simply that,who if anyone would type the keyword zesto, therefore we must try to build our brand by ensuring that generic keywords associated with our products (citrus peel) are used throughout our site as well as search engine submissions.<BR>Fortunately owning a non generic domain short, easy to remember and trademarked works in our favor because the marketability potential is limitless.<BR>Arlene Turner  <a href='http://www.zesto.com'>http://www.zesto.com</a>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=To change your subscribed address,<br>send both new and old address to <a href='mailto:Submit@AEOpublishing.com'>Submit</a><br>See below for unsubscribe instructions.<p>Please send suggestions and comments to: <a href='mailto:Editor@AEOpublishing.com'>Editor</a><br>I invite you to send your real successes and showcase your strategies and techniques, or yes, even your total bombs, 'Working Together We Can All Prosper.' <a href='mailto:Submit@AEOpublishing.com'>Submit</a><p>For information on how to sponsor Your Membership Community &amp: Commentary visit: <a href='http://bannersgomlm.com/ezine'>SponsorshipShowcase</a><p>Copyright 2001 AEOpublishing.com------------------------------------------------email:  YourMembership2@AEOpublishing.comvoice:  web: http://www.AEOpublishing.com------------------------------------------------This email has been sent to jm@netnoteinc.com at your request, by Your Membership Newsletter Services.Visit our Subscription Center to edit your interests or unsubscribe.http://ccprod.roving.com/roving/d.jsp?p=oo&id=bd7n7877.7giv5d57&m=bd7n7877&ea=jm@netnoteinc.comView our privacy policy: http://ccprod.roving.com/roving/CCPrivacyPolicy.jspPowered by Constant Contact(R)www.constantcontact.com---1347074105.994417746234.JavaMail.RovAdmin.rovweb002Content-Type: text/html: charset=iso-8859-1<HTML><!-- &nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp:HTML-FORMATTED MESSAGE BELOWThe remainder of this message is in HTML format for use by emailclients that can properly display it.

What you do to  <BR>become successful in the online world is not a 'secret',  <BR>in my opinion. Most successful people follow simple, clear,  <BR>repeatedly-proven strategies to succeed, whether on the  <BR>Net or off. <BR> <BR>But, when it comes to someone asking for advice,  <BR>consultation, or simply asking, 'What's your secret?',  <BR>I have to blush & say ... <BR> <BR>Persistence and personality. <BR> <BR>Of course, I always follow the advice with my own little  <BR>disclaimer: What makes ME successful may not work the  <BR>same for YOU ... & your first lesson is to get over  <BR>the deep-seeded idea that success - of any kind, in   <BR>my opinion - is somehow an unknown, unattainable secret. <BR> <BR>Clearly, it is not. It's not unknown. It's not unattainable.  <BR>It's not years of digging to find the 'secrets' to internet riches. <BR> <BR>One thing that 'gets to me' so often in my work as an  <BR>Internet Consultant, author and Internet Success  <BR>Strategist is that so many people on the Net seem to  <BR>have this incredibly huge mental block that stands  <BR>between themselves and success on the Net. It's  <BR>almost as if they've been barraged by so many claims  <BR>of what works and what doesn't work, and so many  <BR>LONG, complicated routes to actually succeeding in  <BR>their online venture, that 'success' is the  <BR>equivelant of a 100-foot high brick wall. <BR> <BR>It's NOT that difficult, my friends! It is NOT that complicated!! <BR> <BR>Long-time friend and business associate Rick Beneteau  <BR>has a new eBook out called Branding YOU & Breaking <BR>the Bank. Get it!!  <BR><a href='http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb'>http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb</a> .  <BR>But, the reason I mention this is the fact that he talks  <BR>so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your  <BR>online venture a success.  <BR> <BR>And, yes, Rick & I come from the same school of  <BR>'self marketing' - marketing YOU! Obviously, that's  <BR>the core of his excellent new ebook, and I couldn't  <BR>agree with him more. <BR> <BR>Point being, *you* ARE everything you do online to  <BR>succeed. You ARE your web site, your business, your  <BR>marketing piece, your customer service, your customers'  <BR>experiences with your business -- ALL of it, is YOU!  <BR>Read his ebook & you'll see more of what I'm saying. <BR> <BR>The matter at hand is that brick wall you might have  <BR>standing high as you can see, blocking the path  <BR>between you & internet success. Listen to me - it is  <BR>not real OK? It doesn't exist. There's nothing there  <BR>to fear to begin with ... get over it!! <BR> <BR>What I'm telling you is, the only thing standing between  <BR>you and the success you most desire ... is yourself.  <BR>When you realize this, you will tear down that brick  <BR>wall by means of complete and instantaneous  <BR>disintegration. It will no longer exist *in your mind*,  <BR>which is the only 'real' place it ever was anyhow! <BR> <BR>Yes, 'persistence and personality' inherently includes  <BR>honesty, integrity, accountability, and many other  <BR>qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate  <BR>goals and realize that probably the most valuable,   <BR>powerful key to your success ... is YOU! <BR> <BR>That may be the most incredible 'secret' we ever  <BR>uncover in our lifetime! And, trust me, that brick wall  <BR>won't ever get in your way again ... unless you let it. <BR> <BR>Talk about SIMPLE!! <BR> <BR>------------------------------------------------------ <BR>Bryan is a 'veteran'  Internet  Consultant, Author,  <BR>Internet Success Strategist & Marketer.

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability. It isbeing taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford Research and theWall Street Journal have stated that between 50% and 65% of all goods andservices will be sold through multi-level methods. This is a Multi-BillionDollar industry and of the 500,000 millionaires in the U.S., 20% (100,000) madetheir fortune in the last several years in MLM. Moreover, statistics show45people become millionaires everyday through Multi-Level Marketing. You mayhave heard this story before, but Donald Trump made an appearance on the DavidLetterman show. Dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had tostart over from scratch. Without hesitating Trump said he would find a goodnetwork marketing company and get to work. The audience, started to hoot and boohim. He looked out at the audience and dead-panned his response. 'That's why I'msitting up here and you are all sitting out there!' With network marketing youhave two sources of income. Direct commissions from sales you make yourself andcommissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business. Residualincome is the secret of the wealthy. It means investing time and money once, andgetting paid again and again and again. In network marketing, it also meansgetting paid for the work of others. The enclosed information is something Ialmost let slip through my fingers. Fortunately, sometime later I rereadeverything and gave some thought and study to it. My name is Jonathan Rourke.Two years ago, the corporation I worked at for the past twelve years down- sizedand my position was eliminated. After unproductive job interviews, I decided toopen my own business. Over the past year, I incurred many unforeseen financialproblems. I owed my family, friends and creditors over $35,000. The economy wastaking a toll on my business and I just couldn't seem to make ends meet. I hadto refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and strugglingbusiness. AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened in my life and I amwriting to share that experience in hopes that this will change your lifeFOREVER FINANCIALLY!!! In mid December, I received this program via e-mail. Sixmonth's prior to receiving this program, I had been sending away for informationon various business opportunities. All of the programs I received, in my opinionwere not cost effective. They were either too difficult for me to comprehend orthe initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work ornot. One claimed that I would make a million dollars in one year. It didn't tellme I'd have to write a book to make it! But like I was saying, in December Ireceived this program. I didn't send for it, or ask for it: they just got myname off a mailing list. THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT!!! After reading it severaltimes, to make sure I was reading it correctly, I couldn't believe my eyes. Herewas a MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON. I could invest as much as I wanted to startwithout putting me further into debt. After I got a pencil and paper and figuredit out, I would at least get my money back. But like most of you I was still alittle skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. So Ichecked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161 24 hrs) and theyconfirmed that it is indeed legal! After determining the program was LEGAL andNOT A CHAIN LETTER, I decided 'WHY NOT.' Initially I sent out 10,000 e-mails. Itcost me about $15 for my time on-line. The great thing about e-mail is that Idon't need any money for printing to send out the program, and because all of myorders are filled via e-mail, the only expense is my time. I am telling you likeit is. I hope it doesn't turn you off, but I promised myself that I would not'rip-off' anyone, no matter how much money it cost me. Here is the basic versionof what you need to do: Your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders forReport #1 within 2 weeks of your first program going out. IF YOU DON'T, SEND OUTMORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO. Your second goal is to receive at least 150+ ordersfor Report #2 within 4 weeks. IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO. Onceyou have your 150 orders, relax, you've met your goal. You will make $50,000+but keep at it! If you don't get 150 right off, keep at it! It may take sometime for your down line to build. Keep at it, stay focused, and do not letyourself get distracted. In less than one week, I was starting to receive ordersfor REPORT #1. I kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by January 13, 1had received 26 orders for REPORT #1. My first step in making $50,000 in 90 dayswas done. By January 30, 1 had received 196 orders for REPORT #2: 46 more than Ineeded. So I sat back and relaxed. By March 1, of my e-mailing of 10,000, Ireceived $58,000 with more coming in every day. I paid off ALL my debts andbought a much needed new car. Please take time to read the attached program, ITWILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER!! Remember, it won't work if you don't try it.This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rules ofnot trying to place your name in a different place. It won't work, you'll loseout on a lot of money! In order for this program to work very fast, try to meetyour goal of 20+ orders for Report #1, and 150+ orders for Report #2 and youwill make $50,000 or more in 90 days. If you don't reach the first two goalswith in four weeks, relax, you will still make a ton of money, it may take a fewmonths or so longer. But keep mailing out the programs and stay focused! That'sthe key. I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS!!! If you choose not to participate inthis program, I am sorry. It really is a great opportunity with little cost orrisk to you. If you choose to participate, follow the program and you will be onyour way to financial security. If you are a fellow business owner and are infinancial trouble like I was, or you want to start your own business, considerthis a sign. I DID! -Sincerely, Jonathan Rourke P.S. Do you have any idea what11,700 $5 bills ($58,000) look like piled up on a kitchen table? IT'S AWESOME! APERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: By the time you have read theenclosed program and reports, you should have concluded that such a program, andone that is legal, could not have been created by an amateur. Let me tell you alittle about myself. I had a profitable business for 10 years. Then in 1979 mybusiness began falling off. I was doing the same things that were previouslysuccessful for me, but it wasn't working. Finally, I figured it out. It wasn'tme: it was the economy. Inflation and recession had replaced the stable economythat had been with us since 1945. I don't have to tell you what happened to theunemployment rate...because many of you know from first hand experience. Therewere more failures and bankruptcies than ever before. The middle class wasvanishing. Those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up.Those who did not including those who never had anything to save or invest weremoving down into the ranks of the poor. As the saying goes, 'THE RICH GET RICHERAND THE POOR GET POORER.' The traditional Methods of making money will neverallow you to 'move up' or 'get rich'. Inflation will see to that. You have justreceived information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of yourlife, with 'NO RISK' and 'JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT.' You can make more moneyin the next few months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLYAS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it isnow. Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can thinkof. One of the people you send this to may send out 50,000 ... and your namewill be on everyone of them! Remember though, the more you send out the morepotential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas,information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent. IT ISUP TO YOU NOW! 'THINK ABOUT IT.' Before you delete this program from yourmailbox, as I almost did, take a little time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUTIT. Get a pencil and figure out what could happen when YOU participate. Figureout the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it, you willstill make a lot of money! You will definitely get back what you invested. Anydoubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in. IT WORKS! -JodyJacobs, Richmond, VA HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU THOUSANDS OFDOLLAR$ This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME. I am surethat you could use up to $50,000 or more in the next 90 days. Before you say 'NoWay!' please read this program carefully. This is not a chain letter, but aperfectly legal money making opportunity. Basically, this is what you do: Aswith all multilevel businesses, we- build our business by recruiting newpartners and selling our products. Every state in the USA allows you to recruitnew multilevel business partners, and we offer a product for EVERY dollar sent.YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not involved inpersonal selling. You do it privately in your own home, store, or office. Thisis the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere: This is what you MUSTdo. 1. Order all 5 reports shown on the list below (You can't sell them if youdon't have them). * For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THEREPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME & RETURN ADDRESS (incase of a problem). *MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE - IN CASEOF ANY MAIL PROBLEMS! * When you place your order, make sure you order each ofthe five reports. You need all five reports so that you can save them on yourcomputer and resell them. * Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, eachof the five reports. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible foryou to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. 2. IMPORTANT-DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, ortheir order on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps 'a'through 'g' or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. Once youunderstand the way this works you'll also see how it doesn't work if you changeit. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will notwork. a. Look below for the listing of available reports. b. After you'veordered the. five reports, take this Advertisement and remove the name andaddress under REPORT #5. This person has made it through the cycle and is nodoubt counting their $50,000! c. Move the name and address under REPORT #4 downto REPORT #5. d. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4. e.Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3 f. Move the name andaddress under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2. g. Insert your name and address inthe REPORT #1 position. Please make sure you copy every name and addressACCURATELY! Copy and paste method works well,. 3. Take this entire letter,including the modified list of names, and save it to your computer. Make NOchanges to the Instruction portion of this letter. Your cost to participate inthis is practically nothing (surely you can afford $25). You obviously alreadyhave an Internet Connection and e-mail is FREE! To assist you with marketingyour business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you withinvaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails, whereto find thousands of free classified ads and much, much more. Here are twoprimary methods of building your downline: METHOD #1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL Let'ssay that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we'll assumeyou and all those involved send out only 2,000 programs each. Let's also assumethat the mailing receives a 0.5% response. Using a good list, the response couldbe much better. Also, many people will send out hundreds of thousands ofprograms instead of 2,000. But continuing with this example, you send out only2,000 programs. With a 0.5% response, that is only 10 orders for REPORT #1.Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000 programs each for a total of20,000. Out of those 0.5%, 100 people respond and order REPORT #2. Those 100mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of 200,000. The 0.5% response to thatis 1,000 orders for REPORT #3. Those 1,000 send out 2,000 programs each for a2,000,000 total. The 0.5% response to that is I 0,000 orders for REPORT #4. Thatamounts to 10,000 each of $5 bills for you in CASH MONEY! Then think about levelfive! That's $500,000 alone! Your total income in this example is $50 + $500 +$5,000+ $50,000 + $500,000 for a total of $555,550!!! REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS ISASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE YOU MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHINGAND TRASH THIS PROGRAM! DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IFEVERYONE, OR HALF SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF 2,000. Believe me, manypeople will do just that and more! REPORT #2 will show you the best methods forbulk e-mailing, and e-mail software. METHOD #2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THEINTERNET 1. Advertising on the Net is very, very inexpensive, and there areHUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let's say you decide to start small justto see how well it works. Assume your goal is to get ONLY 10 people toparticipate on your first level. Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet willEASILY get a larger response. Also assume that everyone else in YOURORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members. Follow this example to achieve theSTAGGERING results below: 1st level-your 10 members with $5 ....... $50 2ndlevel-10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100) ....... $500 3rd level-10 members fromthose 100 ($5 x 1,000)....... $5,000 4th level-10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x10k) ....... $50,000 5th level-10 members from those 10,000 ($5 x 100k) .......$500,000 THIS TOTALS - $555,550 Remember friends, this assumes that the peoplewho participate only recruit 10 people each. Think for a moment what wouldhappen if they got 20 people to participate! Most people get 100's ofparticipants. THINK ABOUT IT! For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do ise-mail them the report they ordered. THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICEON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that the e-mail THEY send out with YOUR nameand address on it will be prompt because they can't advertise until they receivethe report! AVAILABLE REPORTS *** Order Each REPORT by NUMBER, AND NAME *** *ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH (U.S. CURRENCY) FOR EACH REPORT. CHECKS NOT ACCEPTED * -ALWAYS SEND YOUR ORDER VIA FIRST CLASS MAIL - Make sure the cash is concealed bywrapping it in at least two sheets of paper (SO THAT THE BILL CAN'T BE SEENAGAINST LIGHT) On one of those sheets of paper include: (a) the number & name ofthe report you are ordering, (b) your e-mail address, and (c) your name & postaladdress (in case your e-mail provider encounters problems).

My wife, Jody, and I live inChicago, IL. I am a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I makepretty good money. When I received the program I grumbled to Jody aboutreceiving 'junk mail.' I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge ofthe population and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totallyignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made mercilessfun of her, and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the thingdidn't work... well, the laugh was on me! Within two weeks she had received over50 responses. Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I wasshocked! I was sure that I had it all figured and that it wouldn't work. I AM abeliever now. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby. ' I did have seven more yearsuntil retirement, but I think of the 'rat race,' and it's not for me. We owe itall to MLM. -Mitchell Wolf MD., Chicago, IL. The. main reason for this letter isto convince you that this system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and isa way to get a large amount of money in a short time. I was approached severaltimes before 1 checked this out. I joined just to see what one could expect inreturn for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment I received$36,470.00 in the first 14 weeks, with money still coming in. -Charles Morris,Esq. Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind toparticipate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initialinvestment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enoughorders to at least get my money back. Boy, was I surprised when I found mymedium- size post office box crammed with orders! For awhile, it got sooverloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the window. I'll make moremoney this year than any 10 years of my life before. The nice thing about thisdeal is that it doesn't matter where people live. There simply isn't a betterinvestment with a faster return. -Paige Willis, Des Moines, IA I had receivedthis program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I shouldn't havegiven it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, soI had to wait until I was e-mailed another program ... 11 months passed then itcame ... I didn't delete this one! ... I made. more than $41,000 on the firsttry!! -Violet Wilson, Johnstown, PA This is my third time to participate in thisplan.

We look at the top five web sites in your category and use the same meta tags and key words that they use.If it works for them it will work for you!So YOUR web site can beFOUND and SEENFor Twelve Months! Guaranteed! (See our testimonials)Think about it!Just as you have a web designer to build your site and a company to host your site,does it not make sense to use a company that specializes in professionally submitting your web site.Getting your web site FOUND and SEEN! A Shocking Fact!Your web site designer and your host are NOT responsible for getting your web site seen!  Yes, they may submit your site to a few search engines periodically but to stay on the TOP of the search engines is an aggressive business.Getting onto the search engines and at the top of their listings doesn't  just happen.You have to be put there!What the.Net, The Internet Magazine 8/2000 said:'You have your web site designed and have sorted out the maintenance and waiting for the business to roll in, but there's one small problem.... No one knows!'You need a professional company to do it!Your Money BackGuarantee!If you do not receive confirmation from the search engines that we submit your web site to, we will give you your money back! Guaranteed!There is nothing to lose!Some testimonials of those that have usedRegal Telecom'This service is my secret weapon. I never believed it was possible to have such a rapid response.' etvcom.tv'I have been truly amazed by the results.

I definitely recommend it!Worth every penny!' keyhomes.net'We run a Cancer Clinic and it is essential that our web site is submitted to as many search engines as possible. We are looking forward to having the capability to do online video conferencing and online diagnosis with our patients from many parts of the world.

A search engine is like an enormous 'yellow pages' with thousands of companies advertising the same product.  Unless you are near the front of the listing your chances of a customer actually seeing you is remote.  Unlike a literal yellow pages there is a way to move YOU to the front and also get you on all of the 'Yellow pages' in the world.What does it take to be seen on theSearch Engines?Appreciate the Three Golden Rulesq Search engines do not pull up the web sites at random they use a specific method of search. Those that know them are the ones at the top, those that do not are buried at the bottom!q Your web site must be submitted to the search engines every month otherwise your site gets pushed off (Its a bit like a Ferris wheel, you get on and then after a while you are taken off unless you get another ticket and get back on).q Understand the importance of Keywords, Meta tags, and Titles employed when submitting your site to the search engines!Use the right ones and you go up.Get it wrong and you go to the bottom!Some feel that it is enough to be on the large search engines.Wrong! The problem is because of their sheer size most web sites get buried.  Having your web site professionally submitted can boost you up the listings of these larger search engines, so you can be found on them.  Also many people use the smaller search engines and if your site is professionally submitted your chances of getting to the top are greatly increased.It is essential to be on them!Having Regal Telecom expertly submit your web site every month to worlds search engines will give YOU the Advantage you need. This can make the difference between new customersFINDING your web site or NOT!Be on ALL of theseSearch Engines Excite, Altavista, Google, Hotboot, WhatUseek, Lycos, WebCrawler, NorthernLight,

Also in the second or third paragraph is a misspelled word which should be 'first-come' not as shown on the page.<p>I feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should be displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered on the site. I will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter.  <p>As has been mentioned many times, some information about the person doing the page is always good.  We need some information about why this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to. <br>~~~~<p>Dennis - I took a look at your site, and have recommendations for improving your page.<br>1- I use Internet Explorer and view web pages with my text size set to 'smaller'. The text you used was quite large, like a font used for a heading for all the text. By making the text size smaller it wouldn't feel like you were screaming at me. Also, the background was just too much.<br>2- There were spelling errors in the text. Often it might be difficult for you to spot these yourself if you see the page all the time, but have a friend look it over. Spelling errors make the page look unprofessional.<br>3- Offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like before they subscribe. Also, if you are asking for a person to give you their email address, you MUST have a privacy policy and let them know they can unsubscribe.<br>4- Think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter. It looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to.<br>5- Offer information about yourself, and the kinds of information your newsletter contains. Maybe extend your site to include back issues or an archive to see what information you have offered in the past.<br>6- Build another page for 'sponsoring info' and put prices on that page. Remove all pricing information from the home page.<br>~~~~<p>I feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text. I also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read quickly, and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily. I noticed some spelling errors, and I think that a link to the classifieds site should be provided, and online payments should be accepted. A site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it!<br>~~~~<p>This is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the message.  I did not like the background colour, however that is personal, it did not detract from the information.  I was tempted to sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see a current issue. There was an error in the wording (a word missed) which needs correction and I think the fonts could be smaller. Overall a non-confusing site which makes a nice change. *cheers*<br>~~~~<p>Could use a better background and the fonts are very large, there also are errors in the following paragraphs : 'first com-first serve' and 'to place a sponsor advertisement, send your to my email'<br>~~~~<p>A single page site. It is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster's newsletter to see what he's doing, and it doesn't seem to me to be a way to get people to visit. I wouldn't, for example. He claims to have lots of tidbits of information that, he says, we probably didn't know, and this is possible, but in my opinion, he would be better served if he at least put some of the things out there for all to see - when the appetite, so to speak, if he want people to subscribe. As it is, I would not bother.<br>~~~~<p>What does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo? Some useful resources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy advertisement on the net. But what we get here is a newsletter with the owner (whose email reads damorgarjr@yahoo.com) asking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free 4-line ad. He also tells of paid category of advertisements. This is all we get from a site which has a grand title. Even the information about the newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about 35-to-40 points size which gets difficult to read. <br>~~~~<p>A neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on the eyes. There is only really one problem with this page - its just an advertisement for a newsletter. No, scratch that, its an advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter. A bold enough move perhaps but I learned hardly anything about the newsletter itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of ads to my email account so I didn't even subscribe. Presumably you'd want to get people to sign up so might I suggest splitting the page into the newsletter itself, perhaps a sample issue, a privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click for more info on your free ads. <p>________________________________________<br><b>VOTE ON YOUR FAVORITE WEBSITE DESIGN!</b><br>Help out the winner of the free website redesign by voting for YOUR favorite!  <p>You can help out Teddy at <a href='http://www.links4profit.com'> links4profit.com</a> by taking a look at his site, then checking out the three new layouts Jana of AkkaBay Designs <a href='http://AkkaBay.com'>AkkaBay.com</a> has designed specifically for him.

Also in the second or third paragraph is a misspelled word which should be 'first-come' not as shown on the page.<p>I feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should be displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered on the site. I will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter.  <p>As has been mentioned many times, some information about the person doing the page is always good.  We need some information about why this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to. <br>~~~~<p>Dennis - I took a look at your site, and have recommendations for improving your page.<br>1- I use Internet Explorer and view web pages with my text size set to 'smaller'. The text you used was quite large, like a font used for a heading for all the text. By making the text size smaller it wouldn't feel like you were screaming at me. Also, the background was just too much.<br>2- There were spelling errors in the text. Often it might be difficult for you to spot these yourself if you see the page all the time, but have a friend look it over. Spelling errors make the page look unprofessional.<br>3- Offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like before they subscribe. Also, if you are asking for a person to give you their email address, you MUST have a privacy policy and let them know they can unsubscribe.<br>4- Think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter. It looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to.<br>5- Offer information about yourself, and the kinds of information your newsletter contains. Maybe extend your site to include back issues or an archive to see what information you have offered in the past.<br>6- Build another page for 'sponsoring info' and put prices on that page. Remove all pricing information from the home page.<br>~~~~<p>I feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text. I also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read quickly, and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily. I noticed some spelling errors, and I think that a link to the classifieds site should be provided, and online payments should be accepted. A site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it!<br>~~~~<p>This is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the message.  I did not like the background colour, however that is personal, it did not detract from the information.  I was tempted to sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see a current issue. There was an error in the wording (a word missed) which needs correction and I think the fonts could be smaller. Overall a non-confusing site which makes a nice change. *cheers*<br>~~~~<p>Could use a better background and the fonts are very large, there also are errors in the following paragraphs : 'first com-first serve' and 'to place a sponsor advertisement, send your to my email'<br>~~~~<p>A single page site. It is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster's newsletter to see what he's doing, and it doesn't seem to me to be a way to get people to visit. I wouldn't, for example. He claims to have lots of tidbits of information that, he says, we probably didn't know, and this is possible, but in my opinion, he would be better served if he at least put some of the things out there for all to see - when the appetite, so to speak, if he want people to subscribe. As it is, I would not bother.<br>~~~~<p>What does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo? Some useful resources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy advertisement on the net. But what we get here is a newsletter with the owner (whose email reads damorgarjr@yahoo.com) asking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free 4-line ad. He also tells of paid category of advertisements. This is all we get from a site which has a grand title. Even the information about the newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about 35-to-40 points size which gets difficult to read. <br>~~~~<p>A neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on the eyes. There is only really one problem with this page - its just an advertisement for a newsletter. No, scratch that, its an advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter. A bold enough move perhaps but I learned hardly anything about the newsletter itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of ads to my email account so I didn't even subscribe. Presumably you'd want to get people to sign up so might I suggest splitting the page into the newsletter itself, perhaps a sample issue, a privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click for more info on your free ads. <p>________________________________________<br><b>VOTE ON YOUR FAVORITE WEBSITE DESIGN!</b><br>Help out the winner of the free website redesign by voting for YOUR favorite!  <p>You can help out Teddy at <a href='http://www.links4profit.com'> links4profit.com</a> by taking a look at his site, then checking out the three new layouts Jana of AkkaBay Designs <a href='http://AkkaBay.com'>AkkaBay.com</a> has designed specifically for him.

ANYONE can earn a living online.&nbsp: Really, they<br>can.&nbsp: But, it takes several very important components to<br>join the 5% who are successful on the web.<p>&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp: One of those necessities is a website.<p>&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp: Now, your website does one of two things...<p>&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp: ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.<p>For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do<br>not produce results.<p>And there is a very simple reason for poor performance.<br>Poor sales letters.<p>Does your website convince people to make a purchase?<br>If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into<br>your sales letter...<p>1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind.<br>Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your<br>sales letter to.&nbsp: Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your<br>next door neighbor or your cat.&nbsp: Write your sales letter<br>just like you are writing it to them personally.&nbsp: Why?<br>Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will<br>seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.<br>Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going<br>to be read to an audience rather than one person.&nbsp: Keep your<br>sales letters personal, because one person at a time is<br>going to read them.<p>2) Use an illustration to get your point across.&nbsp: In my<br>sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on<br>the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must<br>constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our<br>businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily<br>making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback<br>across Montana on a grizzly bear.&nbsp: Leads have read of how<br>getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively<br>marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home<br>a solid message.&nbsp: Tell stories that illustrate a point you<br>are trying to make.&nbsp: Emphasize a benefit by sharing an<br>account from the 'real world.'&nbsp: It effectively creates<br>interest and further establishes the point.<p>3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first<br>line.&nbsp: Your first line of the sales letter should<br>immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know<br>more.&nbsp: Go back to the beginning of this article.&nbsp: The first<br>words were, 'It's true.'&nbsp: I can guarantee you that either<br>consciously or subconsciously you thought 'What's true?'<br>Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking<br>about.&nbsp: Before you even knew it you were right here, 8<br>paragraphs into this article.&nbsp: Carefully craft your first<br>line.&nbsp: If you can immediately get them wanting to know more,<br>you've got a winner.<p>4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted<br>lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use<br>bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or<br>service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.<br>Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight<br>each line and create a sense of more length to the list.<p>5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.&nbsp: Shortly after<br>your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet<br>list of benefits to absorb.&nbsp: Hit them with your best shot.<br>Pull out the big guns and stress 'just a few of' the most<br>important things the reader will discover.&nbsp: By offering a<br>killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically<br>create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad<br>copy.&nbsp: After all, if they are already interested after the<br>first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to<br>finding out even more reasons why your product or service<br>will aid them.<p>6) Just let it all flow out.&nbsp: Write down everything that<br>enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You<br>can edit it later.&nbsp: If you just sit and start writing<br>everything you know about your product or service and how it<br>will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much<br>information floods your mind.&nbsp: Write it ALL down.&nbsp: Then read<br>through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to<br>many of the points.&nbsp: Edit it after you have exhausted all<br>of your ideas.<p>7) Make your sales letter personal.&nbsp: Make sure that the<br>words 'you' and 'your' are at least 4:1 over 'I' and 'my.'<br>Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not<br>yourself.&nbsp: I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,<br>but it's something like this, 'I don't care a thing about<br>your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.'&nbsp: Leads aren't<br>interested in you or your products, they are interested in<br>themselves and their wants and needs.&nbsp: When you are finished<br>with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test<br>webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see<br>what the ratio between 'you' and 'your' versus references to<br>'I,' 'me,' 'my,' etc.&nbsp: It's a free service.&nbsp: Make sure it's<br>at least 4:1 in favor of the customer.<p>8) Write like you speak.&nbsp: Forget all of those rules that<br>your grammar teacher taught you.&nbsp: Write your sales letters<br>in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.<br>Don't be afraid to begin sentences with 'And' or 'Because.'<br>Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.<br>Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great<br>American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest<br>Hemingway.<p>9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.<br>Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.&nbsp: Use short<br>paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be<br>afraid to use short sentences.&nbsp: Like this one.<p>Or this.<p>See what I mean?&nbsp: Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of<br>the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often<br>force the reader to get distracted.<p>10)&nbsp: Stress the benefits, not the features.&nbsp: Again,<br>readers want the burning question answered, 'What's in it<br>for&nbsp: me?'&nbsp: What need is it going to meet? What want is it<br>going to fill?&nbsp: How is your product or service going to be<br>of value or benefit to the reader?&nbsp: Spell it out.&nbsp: Don't<br>focus on the features of your product or service , but<br>rather how those features will add value to the life of your<br>reader.<p>For example:&nbsp: If you are selling automobile tires, you may<br>very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,<br>but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I<br>do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while<br>we are traveling.&nbsp: So, instead of focusing on your selection,<br>you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe<br>because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not<br>selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress<br>the benefits, not the features.<p>11) Keep the reader interested.&nbsp: Some sales letters read<br>like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can<br>perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are<br>filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to<br>understand.&nbsp: Unless you are writing to a very targeted<br>audience, avoid using technical language that many readers<br>might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language<br>and information that are easy to understand and follow.<p>12) Target your sales letter.&nbsp: When you are finished with<br>your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a<br>specific audience.&nbsp: For example: If you are selling a 'work<br>at home' product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding<br>words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards<br>women who are homemakers.&nbsp: Then, rewrite the same sales<br>letter and target it to college students.&nbsp: Write another<br>letter targeting senior citizens.&nbsp: Still another could be<br>written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income<br>during summer vacation.&nbsp: The possibilities are endless.<p>All you need to do is add a few words here and there in<br>your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service<br>is specifically designed for a target audience. 'Work only<br>5 hours a week,' would become 'College Students, work only<br>5 hours a week.'&nbsp: Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload<br>all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website<br>(you could easily target 100's of groups).<p>Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted<br>mediums.&nbsp: You could advertise the 'College Students' page<br>in a campus ezine.&nbsp: The 'Senior Citizens' page could be<br>advertised at a retirement community message board.<p>By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally<br>open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product<br>to.&nbsp: And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a<br>match made for them.<p>13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.&nbsp: Use short sentences<br>and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention<br>grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One<br>thing that I have always found to work very well in sales<br>letters...<p>&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp: ...is to use a pause like this.<p>Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting<br>to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also,<br>if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on<br>several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook<br>line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. 'Let's<br>get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK<br>HERE to continue.'<p>14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.&nbsp: When the<br>customer purchases your product, they will generate 'a flood<br>of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark.'<br>If they do not order today, then they will 'feel like a cat<br>that let the mouse get away.'&nbsp: Use words to create a picture<br>in the readers' mind.&nbsp: When you think of Superman, what<br>comes to mind?&nbsp: Immediately, we remember that he is 'faster<br>than a speeding bullet.'&nbsp: 'More powerful than a locomotive.'<br>'Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.' See how<br>word pictures stick in our minds?<p>15) Focus on one product or service.&nbsp: Don't try to sell<br>your customer multiple products at the same time. It only<br>confuses the reader.&nbsp: Keep your ad copy directed at one<br>specific product or service.&nbsp: Then, use other products and<br>services as back-end products.<p>16) Make it stand out.&nbsp: Don't kid yourself.&nbsp: There are<br>hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the<br>same thing you are doing.&nbsp: How will you stand out among the<br>crowd?&nbsp: Your sales letter must inject personality. It must<br>breathe of originality.&nbsp: Your product or service is<br>different. It's not like all of the rest.&nbsp: It is unique.<br>Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the<br>competition.&nbsp: It must create a feeling of 'You won't find<br>this anywhere else.'<p>17) Be believable. 'Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!'<br>Delete.&nbsp: Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or<br>something?&nbsp: Get real.&nbsp: Don't make outrageous claims that<br>are obviously not the truth.&nbsp: You'll ruin your reputation.<br>Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be<br>reversed.&nbsp: Once you have been branded a liar, you will<br>NEVER be anything but a liar.&nbsp: It doesn't matter if you<br>launch the most respectable, honest business available<br>anywhere, people will always have doubt because they<br>remember the crazy stuff you've said before.&nbsp: Be believable.<br>Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.<p>18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but<br>rather be EXACT.&nbsp: Instead of 'over 100 tips for losing<br>weight' use '124 tips for losing weight.' By generalizing<br>information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's<br>mind.&nbsp: 'What am I really getting here?&nbsp: Does he even know?'<br>When you use specific information, the reader begins to<br>think, 'This person must have counted.&nbsp: I know exactly what<br>I can expect.'&nbsp: 'Platitudes and generalities roll off the<br>human understanding like water from a duck,' wrote Claude<br>Hopkins in his classic book 'Scientific Advertising.' 'They<br>leave no impression whatsoever.'<p>19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would<br>want to know about your product or service.&nbsp: Answer all of<br>their questions, anything they would want to consider before<br>making a purchase.&nbsp: Think about it from their point of view.<br>Ask yourself, 'Why wouldn't I buy this?'&nbsp: Then, address that<br>in your sales letter.&nbsp: Remove anything that would keep the<br>reader from making the purchase.<p>20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.&nbsp: Share actual<br>excerpts from what your current customers are saying about<br>your product or service. Many websites have an entire<br>section or even a separate page that has endorsements and<br>compliments listed.&nbsp: Satisfied customers remove some of the<br>doubt in the mind of the reader.&nbsp: 'If these people have<br>found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I<br>probably will too.'&nbsp: Especially effective are testimonials<br>from respected, well known 'authorities' within your target<br>field.<p>21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.<br>A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your<br>ad copy.&nbsp: Use them frequently -but don't overuse.&nbsp: A well-<br>placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings<br>them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next<br>paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on<br>your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.&nbsp: They are<br>that important.<p>22) Avoid asking stupid questions.&nbsp: 'Wouldn't you like to<br>make $1,000,000 a year?' 'Doesn't that sound great?' 'Would<br>you like to be as successful as I am?'&nbsp: Avoid any question<br>that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them<br>feel like they are inferior.<p>23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.<br>If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a<br>purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try<br>to influence them to buy in the future.&nbsp: By offering a free<br>item, you can&nbsp: request their email address in order to<br>obtain the freebie.&nbsp: By doing this, you can now follow-up<br>with the customer for a potential future sale.<br>Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having<br>your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.<br>And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful<br>product or service which impresses the customer, they<br>probably will be back as a customer soon.<p>24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.&nbsp: One of the things<br>that I have found very effective in writing sales letters<br>is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product<br>I am offering.&nbsp: Ginsu made this one famous. They were<br>selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial<br>was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table<br>it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality<br>bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages<br>the credibility of your main offer.<p>25) Use connective phrases like 'But wait, there's more'<br>and 'But that's not all.'&nbsp: These phrases effectively lead<br>the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly<br>when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or<br>leads into bonus items.&nbsp: Again, the idea is MORE and MORE<br>value and benefits to the reader.<p>26) Always include a deadline.&nbsp: By including a deadline,<br>you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.<br>'If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the<br>bonuses.'&nbsp: 'Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,<br>I've got to hurry.'&nbsp: Let the customer know what they will<br>be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember,<br>they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will<br>miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines<br>are very effective.&nbsp: Every sales letter should have one.<p>27) Tell them exactly how to order.&nbsp: Be clear as to the<br>order process. Point them towards the order link.&nbsp: Tell<br>them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks,<br>etc.)&nbsp: Make this process as simple and clear as can be.<br>If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.<p>28)&nbsp: Explain when the product will be delivered.&nbsp: How<br>quickly will the order be processed?&nbsp: When will the order be<br>available?&nbsp: Let the customer know exactly what they can<br>expect when they place their order.&nbsp: The more specific you<br>can be here, the better.&nbsp: Let them know that you have a<br>system in place.&nbsp: 'Operators are standing by.'&nbsp: Their order<br>will be handled properly.&nbsp: Tell them.<p>29) Offer a money back guarantee.&nbsp: Take away their last<br>reason to hold back.&nbsp: Offer a 'no questions asked' 30 day<br>guarantee.&nbsp: Most people may not realize this, but in most<br>cases, it's the law of the land.&nbsp: You are REQUIRED to give<br>them their money back if they are not satisfied with the<br>product or service.&nbsp: Since it's the law anyway, why not make<br>it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your<br>product or service RISK-FREE.<p>30) Instruct them to respond immediately.&nbsp: Many people<br>just need to read those words, 'Act Now!'&nbsp: 'Order today!'<br>'Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.'&nbsp: You've got them<br>this far, now tell them what you want them to do.&nbsp: Get them<br>to 'Act Fast!'&nbsp: Have you ever heard a mail order commercial<br>on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right<br>way?<p>31) Include a post script.&nbsp: People will always read the<br>P.S.&nbsp: Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT<br>parts of your sales letter. Why?&nbsp: Because in many cases the<br>visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the<br>end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.&nbsp: A<br>P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they<br>see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed<br>description of what they will receive for their money. Use<br>your P.S. to restate your offer in detail.<p>32) Include a second post script.&nbsp: You better believe<br>if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.&nbsp: Use<br>this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer<br>another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would<br>make them want to order.&nbsp: I guarantee you they will read it.<p>Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see<br>a significant increase in the amount of responses you<br>receive from your sales letters.&nbsp: In fact, it would be<br>impossible for your responses to not improve.<br>&nbsp:<p>Copyright 2000 Jimmy D.

ANYONE can earn a living online.&nbsp: Really, they<br>can.&nbsp: But, it takes several very important components to<br>join the 5% who are successful on the web.<p>&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp: One of those necessities is a website.<p>&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp: Now, your website does one of two things...<p>&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp: ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.<p>For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do<br>not produce results.<p>And there is a very simple reason for poor performance.<br>Poor sales letters.<p>Does your website convince people to make a purchase?<br>If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into<br>your sales letter...<p>1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind.<br>Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your<br>sales letter to.&nbsp: Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your<br>next door neighbor or your cat.&nbsp: Write your sales letter<br>just like you are writing it to them personally.&nbsp: Why?<br>Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will<br>seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.<br>Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going<br>to be read to an audience rather than one person.&nbsp: Keep your<br>sales letters personal, because one person at a time is<br>going to read them.<p>2) Use an illustration to get your point across.&nbsp: In my<br>sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on<br>the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must<br>constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our<br>businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily<br>making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback<br>across Montana on a grizzly bear.&nbsp: Leads have read of how<br>getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively<br>marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home<br>a solid message.&nbsp: Tell stories that illustrate a point you<br>are trying to make.&nbsp: Emphasize a benefit by sharing an<br>account from the 'real world.'&nbsp: It effectively creates<br>interest and further establishes the point.<p>3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first<br>line.&nbsp: Your first line of the sales letter should<br>immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know<br>more.&nbsp: Go back to the beginning of this article.&nbsp: The first<br>words were, 'It's true.'&nbsp: I can guarantee you that either<br>consciously or subconsciously you thought 'What's true?'<br>Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking<br>about.&nbsp: Before you even knew it you were right here, 8<br>paragraphs into this article.&nbsp: Carefully craft your first<br>line.&nbsp: If you can immediately get them wanting to know more,<br>you've got a winner.<p>4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted<br>lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use<br>bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or<br>service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.<br>Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight<br>each line and create a sense of more length to the list.<p>5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.&nbsp: Shortly after<br>your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet<br>list of benefits to absorb.&nbsp: Hit them with your best shot.<br>Pull out the big guns and stress 'just a few of' the most<br>important things the reader will discover.&nbsp: By offering a<br>killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically<br>create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad<br>copy.&nbsp: After all, if they are already interested after the<br>first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to<br>finding out even more reasons why your product or service<br>will aid them.<p>6) Just let it all flow out.&nbsp: Write down everything that<br>enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You<br>can edit it later.&nbsp: If you just sit and start writing<br>everything you know about your product or service and how it<br>will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much<br>information floods your mind.&nbsp: Write it ALL down.&nbsp: Then read<br>through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to<br>many of the points.&nbsp: Edit it after you have exhausted all<br>of your ideas.<p>7) Make your sales letter personal.&nbsp: Make sure that the<br>words 'you' and 'your' are at least 4:1 over 'I' and 'my.'<br>Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not<br>yourself.&nbsp: I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,<br>but it's something like this, 'I don't care a thing about<br>your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.'&nbsp: Leads aren't<br>interested in you or your products, they are interested in<br>themselves and their wants and needs.&nbsp: When you are finished<br>with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test<br>webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see<br>what the ratio between 'you' and 'your' versus references to<br>'I,' 'me,' 'my,' etc.&nbsp: It's a free service.&nbsp: Make sure it's<br>at least 4:1 in favor of the customer.<p>8) Write like you speak.&nbsp: Forget all of those rules that<br>your grammar teacher taught you.&nbsp: Write your sales letters<br>in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.<br>Don't be afraid to begin sentences with 'And' or 'Because.'<br>Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.<br>Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great<br>American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest<br>Hemingway.<p>9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.<br>Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.&nbsp: Use short<br>paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be<br>afraid to use short sentences.&nbsp: Like this one.<p>Or this.<p>See what I mean?&nbsp: Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of<br>the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often<br>force the reader to get distracted.<p>10)&nbsp: Stress the benefits, not the features.&nbsp: Again,<br>readers want the burning question answered, 'What's in it<br>for&nbsp: me?'&nbsp: What need is it going to meet? What want is it<br>going to fill?&nbsp: How is your product or service going to be<br>of value or benefit to the reader?&nbsp: Spell it out.&nbsp: Don't<br>focus on the features of your product or service , but<br>rather how those features will add value to the life of your<br>reader.<p>For example:&nbsp: If you are selling automobile tires, you may<br>very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,<br>but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I<br>do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while<br>we are traveling.&nbsp: So, instead of focusing on your selection,<br>you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe<br>because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not<br>selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress<br>the benefits, not the features.<p>11) Keep the reader interested.&nbsp: Some sales letters read<br>like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can<br>perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are<br>filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to<br>understand.&nbsp: Unless you are writing to a very targeted<br>audience, avoid using technical language that many readers<br>might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language<br>and information that are easy to understand and follow.<p>12) Target your sales letter.&nbsp: When you are finished with<br>your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a<br>specific audience.&nbsp: For example: If you are selling a 'work<br>at home' product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding<br>words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards<br>women who are homemakers.&nbsp: Then, rewrite the same sales<br>letter and target it to college students.&nbsp: Write another<br>letter targeting senior citizens.&nbsp: Still another could be<br>written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income<br>during summer vacation.&nbsp: The possibilities are endless.<p>All you need to do is add a few words here and there in<br>your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service<br>is specifically designed for a target audience. 'Work only<br>5 hours a week,' would become 'College Students, work only<br>5 hours a week.'&nbsp: Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload<br>all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website<br>(you could easily target 100's of groups).<p>Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted<br>mediums.&nbsp: You could advertise the 'College Students' page<br>in a campus ezine.&nbsp: The 'Senior Citizens' page could be<br>advertised at a retirement community message board.<p>By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally<br>open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product<br>to.&nbsp: And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a<br>match made for them.<p>13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.&nbsp: Use short sentences<br>and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention<br>grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One<br>thing that I have always found to work very well in sales<br>letters...<p>&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp:&nbsp: ...is to use a pause like this.<p>Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting<br>to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also,<br>if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on<br>several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook<br>line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. 'Let's<br>get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK<br>HERE to continue.'<p>14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.&nbsp: When the<br>customer purchases your product, they will generate 'a flood<br>of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark.'<br>If they do not order today, then they will 'feel like a cat<br>that let the mouse get away.'&nbsp: Use words to create a picture<br>in the readers' mind.&nbsp: When you think of Superman, what<br>comes to mind?&nbsp: Immediately, we remember that he is 'faster<br>than a speeding bullet.'&nbsp: 'More powerful than a locomotive.'<br>'Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.' See how<br>word pictures stick in our minds?<p>15) Focus on one product or service.&nbsp: Don't try to sell<br>your customer multiple products at the same time. It only<br>confuses the reader.&nbsp: Keep your ad copy directed at one<br>specific product or service.&nbsp: Then, use other products and<br>services as back-end products.<p>16) Make it stand out.&nbsp: Don't kid yourself.&nbsp: There are<br>hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the<br>same thing you are doing.&nbsp: How will you stand out among the<br>crowd?&nbsp: Your sales letter must inject personality. It must<br>breathe of originality.&nbsp: Your product or service is<br>different. It's not like all of the rest.&nbsp: It is unique.<br>Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the<br>competition.&nbsp: It must create a feeling of 'You won't find<br>this anywhere else.'<p>17) Be believable. 'Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!'<br>Delete.&nbsp: Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or<br>something?&nbsp: Get real.&nbsp: Don't make outrageous claims that<br>are obviously not the truth.&nbsp: You'll ruin your reputation.<br>Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be<br>reversed.&nbsp: Once you have been branded a liar, you will<br>NEVER be anything but a liar.&nbsp: It doesn't matter if you<br>launch the most respectable, honest business available<br>anywhere, people will always have doubt because they<br>remember the crazy stuff you've said before.&nbsp: Be believable.<br>Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.<p>18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but<br>rather be EXACT.&nbsp: Instead of 'over 100 tips for losing<br>weight' use '124 tips for losing weight.' By generalizing<br>information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's<br>mind.&nbsp: 'What am I really getting here?&nbsp: Does he even know?'<br>When you use specific information, the reader begins to<br>think, 'This person must have counted.&nbsp: I know exactly what<br>I can expect.'&nbsp: 'Platitudes and generalities roll off the<br>human understanding like water from a duck,' wrote Claude<br>Hopkins in his classic book 'Scientific Advertising.' 'They<br>leave no impression whatsoever.'<p>19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would<br>want to know about your product or service.&nbsp: Answer all of<br>their questions, anything they would want to consider before<br>making a purchase.&nbsp: Think about it from their point of view.<br>Ask yourself, 'Why wouldn't I buy this?'&nbsp: Then, address that<br>in your sales letter.&nbsp: Remove anything that would keep the<br>reader from making the purchase.<p>20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.&nbsp: Share actual<br>excerpts from what your current customers are saying about<br>your product or service. Many websites have an entire<br>section or even a separate page that has endorsements and<br>compliments listed.&nbsp: Satisfied customers remove some of the<br>doubt in the mind of the reader.&nbsp: 'If these people have<br>found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I<br>probably will too.'&nbsp: Especially effective are testimonials<br>from respected, well known 'authorities' within your target<br>field.<p>21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.<br>A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your<br>ad copy.&nbsp: Use them frequently -but don't overuse.&nbsp: A well-<br>placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings<br>them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next<br>paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on<br>your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.&nbsp: They are<br>that important.<p>22) Avoid asking stupid questions.&nbsp: 'Wouldn't you like to<br>make $1,000,000 a year?' 'Doesn't that sound great?' 'Would<br>you like to be as successful as I am?'&nbsp: Avoid any question<br>that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them<br>feel like they are inferior.<p>23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.<br>If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a<br>purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try<br>to influence them to buy in the future.&nbsp: By offering a free<br>item, you can&nbsp: request their email address in order to<br>obtain the freebie.&nbsp: By doing this, you can now follow-up<br>with the customer for a potential future sale.<br>Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having<br>your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.<br>And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful<br>product or service which impresses the customer, they<br>probably will be back as a customer soon.<p>24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.&nbsp: One of the things<br>that I have found very effective in writing sales letters<br>is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product<br>I am offering.&nbsp: Ginsu made this one famous. They were<br>selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial<br>was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table<br>it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality<br>bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages<br>the credibility of your main offer.<p>25) Use connective phrases like 'But wait, there's more'<br>and 'But that's not all.'&nbsp: These phrases effectively lead<br>the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly<br>when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or<br>leads into bonus items.&nbsp: Again, the idea is MORE and MORE<br>value and benefits to the reader.<p>26) Always include a deadline.&nbsp: By including a deadline,<br>you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.<br>'If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the<br>bonuses.'&nbsp: 'Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,<br>I've got to hurry.'&nbsp: Let the customer know what they will<br>be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember,<br>they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will<br>miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines<br>are very effective.&nbsp: Every sales letter should have one.<p>27) Tell them exactly how to order.&nbsp: Be clear as to the<br>order process. Point them towards the order link.&nbsp: Tell<br>them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks,<br>etc.)&nbsp: Make this process as simple and clear as can be.<br>If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.<p>28)&nbsp: Explain when the product will be delivered.&nbsp: How<br>quickly will the order be processed?&nbsp: When will the order be<br>available?&nbsp: Let the customer know exactly what they can<br>expect when they place their order.&nbsp: The more specific you<br>can be here, the better.&nbsp: Let them know that you have a<br>system in place.&nbsp: 'Operators are standing by.'&nbsp: Their order<br>will be handled properly.&nbsp: Tell them.<p>29) Offer a money back guarantee.&nbsp: Take away their last<br>reason to hold back.&nbsp: Offer a 'no questions asked' 30 day<br>guarantee.&nbsp: Most people may not realize this, but in most<br>cases, it's the law of the land.&nbsp: You are REQUIRED to give<br>them their money back if they are not satisfied with the<br>product or service.&nbsp: Since it's the law anyway, why not make<br>it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your<br>product or service RISK-FREE.<p>30) Instruct them to respond immediately.&nbsp: Many people<br>just need to read those words, 'Act Now!'&nbsp: 'Order today!'<br>'Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.'&nbsp: You've got them<br>this far, now tell them what you want them to do.&nbsp: Get them<br>to 'Act Fast!'&nbsp: Have you ever heard a mail order commercial<br>on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right<br>way?<p>31) Include a post script.&nbsp: People will always read the<br>P.S.&nbsp: Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT<br>parts of your sales letter. Why?&nbsp: Because in many cases the<br>visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the<br>end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.&nbsp: A<br>P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they<br>see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed<br>description of what they will receive for their money. Use<br>your P.S. to restate your offer in detail.<p>32) Include a second post script.&nbsp: You better believe<br>if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.&nbsp: Use<br>this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer<br>another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would<br>make them want to order.&nbsp: I guarantee you they will read it.<p>Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see<br>a significant increase in the amount of responses you<br>receive from your sales letters.&nbsp: In fact, it would be<br>impossible for your responses to not improve.<br>&nbsp:<p>Copyright 2000 Jimmy D.
